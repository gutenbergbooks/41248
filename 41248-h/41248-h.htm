<h2>PREFACE</h2>


<p>The narrative of the Zionists in Gallipoli has
been written during the enforced idleness of the
past month&mdash;a month which has been spent in
endeavouring to recover sufficient health and
strength to enable me to take a further, and, I
trust, a more useful, hand in the Great Drama
now approaching its climax.</p>

<p>In the following pages I have "set down nought
in malice," neither have I given a word of praise
where praise is not due&mdash;and more than due. My
relations with those with whom I came into contact
were excellent, and on the very rare occasions
when they were otherwise, it was not due to any
seeking of mine, but, unfortunately, my temperament
is not such that I can suffer fools gladly.</p>

<p>My story is one of actual happenings, told just
as I saw them with some suggestions thrown in,
and if from these a hint is taken here and there
by those in the "Seats of the Mighty," then so
much the better for our Cause.</p>

<p>My chief object in writing this book is to interest
the Hebrew nation in the fortunes of the
Zionists and show them of what their Russian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>
brothers are capable, even under the command
of an alien in race and religion. Those who have
the patience to follow me through these pages
will, of course, see that I am not by any means an
alien in sympathy and admiration for the people
who have given to the world some of its greatest
men, not to mention The Man who has so profoundly
changed the world's outlook.</p>

<h2>WITH THE ZIONISTS IN GALLIPOLI<br /><br /></h2>

<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>

<h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>


<p>I propose in the following pages to have something
to say on the general policy of the Gallipoli
campaign, and also upon the operations of war
in execution of that policy. Now, in the discussion
of these questions, I shall have some criticisms
to make, so it may not be altogether inappropriate
to give the reader some little idea of a
few at least of my qualifications for such a rôle;
otherwise he might well be tempted to say: "A
fig for this fellow and his criticisms. What is
he but a mere muleteer?"</p>

<p>Perhaps I may remark, to begin with, that
when I took over the command of the Zion Mule
Corps, I knew a great deal about soldiering and
the art of war, but very little about the muleteer
or the artful mule. But that's just "a way we
have in the Army!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
From my boyhood I have either been a soldier
or taken the keenest interest in soldiering, not
only in England but in all parts of the world.
My military experiences extend through home,
India and South Africa, and have been by no
means of a sketchy character. I spent the best
part of three years in South Africa, where I
commanded a Yeomanry regiment, and at times
Regular troops of all arms, during the Boer
War.</p>

<p>Those were glorious days&mdash;days when one
could thoroughly enjoy warfare&mdash;a wild gallop
over the veldt, a good fight in the open, and the
day won by the best men.</p>

<p>In these days war is robbed of all its glory and
romance. It is now but a dyke-maker's job, and
a dirty one at that; but much as the soldier may
dislike this method of warfare, it has come to
stay, and we must make the best of a bad job,
adapt ourselves to the new conditions, and by
sticking it out, as we have always done, wear
down the foe.</p>

<p>In addition to practical experience of soldiers
and soldiering in England, India, and South
Africa, I have watched our troops at work and
play in many out-of-the-way parts of the Empire&mdash;the
King's African Rifles in East Africa and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
Uganda; the Cape Mounted Rifles in South Africa;
the "Waffs" in West Africa; the "Gippies"
in Egypt, and the North-West mounted
men of Canada away in the wilds of the Klondyke.</p>

<p>Nor have I confined my attention to the Empire's
soldiers only.</p>

<p>In my various visits to America, I looked very
keenly into the training and organisation of the
American Army. I was especially fortunate
in being able to do this, as I had the privilege
of being Colonel Theodore Roosevelt's guest at
the White House, while he was President, and
his letters of introduction made me a welcome
visitor everywhere. I saw something of the Cavalry
and Artillery both East and West. I
watched their Infantry amidst the snows of
Alaska. I also noted what excellent game preservers
the Cavalry troopers made in the Yellowstone
Park&mdash;that wonderful National Reserve,
crammed with nature's wonders and denizens of
the wild, where a half-tamed bear gave me the
run of my life!</p>

<p>Whenever I was with American soldiers, their
methods were so like our own that I never could
feel I was with strangers.</p>

<p>There is only one fault to find with America's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
Army, and that is that there is not enough of
it; for its size, I should say that it is one of
the finest in the world. Never have I seen more
efficiency anywhere, more keenness among officers
and N. C. O.'s; and certainly never in any
army have I eaten such delicious food as is
supplied to the American private soldier; the
soldiers' bread, such as I tasted at Fort Riley,
baked in military ovens, cannot be surpassed at
the "Ritz," "Savoy" or "Plaza."</p>

<p>It is incomprehensible to me why the average
American should have such a strong prejudice
against the Army. He seems to imagine that
it is some vague kind of monster which, if he
does not do everything in his power to strangle
and chain up, will one day turn and rend him,
and take all his liberties away.</p>

<p>To give some little idea of the feeling of
Americans towards soldiers or soldiering, I will
relate a little conversation which I overheard at
Davenport, a town away out in the State of
Iowa. I had had a very strenuous morning in
the hot sun, watching the 7th Cavalry at squadron
training and other work, and had got back
to the hotel, thoroughly tired out after my arduous
day. In the afternoon I was sitting on
the shady side of the hotel which was on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
main street; at a table near me were seated
three Americans whose remarks I could not help
overhearing; they were travellers in various
small articles, one of them being a specialist in
neckties; while they were talking two men of
the 7th Cavalry walked past; my friend, the
necktie man, looked after them, shook his head,
and in most contemptuous tones said: "I suppose
we must pay the lazy, useless brutes just
for the look of the thing." The speaker was a
pasty-faced, greasy, fat hybrid, about twenty-eight
years old. I am afraid he was a type of
which there are many in America; their God is
the almighty dollar, an idol the blind worship
of which will one day surely bring its own punishment.</p>

<p>Of course I do not, for a moment, wish it to
be thought that people of this type predominate
in America. I am happy to state that among
her citizens I have met some of the most charming,
hospitable, intellectual, unselfish and noble
people to be found on the face of the globe.</p>

<p>America holds many interests for me, and I
never fail to pay our cousins a visit when the
opportunity occurs. Perhaps the chief of her
attractions, so far as I am concerned, centre in
and around the State of Virginia, that beautiful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
piece of country where most of the great battles
of the Civil War were fought.</p>

<p>All my life I have made a point of studying
military history and the campaigns of the great
Captains of the past. Indeed, I have tramped
over many battlefields in Europe, Asia, Africa
and America, not at all with the idea that the
knowledge would ever prove of value from a
military point of view, but solely because I was
deeply interested in soldierly matters.</p>

<p>In Spain and Flanders I have followed the
footsteps of both Napoleon and Wellington.</p>

<p>In Canada I have sailed up the stately St.
Lawrence, and with Wolfe in imagination again
stormed the Heights of Abraham. When I
stood on those heights some one hundred and
fifty years after the great victory which added
Canada to the Empire, I was able to realise,
more fully than I had ever been able to do from
books, the magnitude of the task which General
Wolfe had before him when, on that fateful
night of the 13th September, 1759, he led his
troops up that precipitous road to victory.</p>

<p>In the United States I have, on horseback and
on foot, followed Stonewall Jackson up and
down the Shenandoah Valley, from Harper's
Ferry (over the Potomac) to the Wilderness,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
where he was seized with such strange inertia,
and on to that fatal Chancellorsville where an
unlucky bullet, fired from his own lines, put an
end to his life and all chances of victory for the
South.</p>

<p>When I was at Washington, General Wotherspoon,
the Chief of the War College there, very
kindly supplied me with maps and notes which
he had himself made of the battlefield of Gettysburg,
and I am convinced that, if General
Longstreet had arrived on the field in time,
victory would have rested with the South;
and I am equally convinced that, if Stonewall
Jackson had been alive, Longstreet would
have been in his proper place at the right
time.</p>

<p>What a pity we have no Stonewall Jackson
with us in these days. How noble is the epitaph
on the monument of this great soldier. I
only quote the words from memory, but they are
something like this:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"When the Almighty in His Omnipotence saw fit to
give victory to the North over the South, He found that
it was first necessary to take to Himself Stonewall Jackson."</p>
</div>

<p>It was a great pleasure to me to see his wife,
Mrs. Stonewall Jackson, when I was at Washington,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
but unfortunately I did not have the
chance of speaking to her.</p>

<p>I was delighted to meet Miss Mary Lee several
times, the daughter of the best loved General
that ever led an Army&mdash;Robert E. Lee, the
Commander-in-Chief of the Confederate Forces.
Miss Lee gave me much pleasure by recounting
many anecdotes about her famous father.
Among other interesting reminiscences she told
me that when the war broke out her youngest
brother was a mere boy still at school, but the
stirring accounts of the great fights in which his
father commanded and his older brothers took
part, so fired his ardour that one day he disappeared
from school, and was not heard of by any
of his family for the best part of a year. During
this time he served as a soldier in a battery
of Artillery. One day, while a furious battle was
raging and the fortunes of war swayed first to
the South and then to the North, General Lee
observed some of his guns rapidly retiring from
a particularly hot position. He galloped up to
them himself and ordered them back into the
fight. The Commander-in-Chief was somewhat
surprised when a powder-blackened, mud-grimed
young soldier, in a blood-stained shirt,
said to him: "What, Dad, back into that hell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
again?"&mdash;and back into that hell the General
sternly sent them at a gallop, and by so doing
won the day for the South. Luckily, his boy
came out of the battle unscathed and is alive to
this day.</p>

<p>A few years ago I received an invitation from
the German General Staff to visit Berlin.
What I saw then, and on subsequent visits, impressed
me very much with the thoroughness of
the German nation, not only from a military, but
also from a civil point of view.</p>

<p>A captain on the Staff was detailed to be my
"bear-leader," while I was in Berlin. As we
were strolling down Unter den Linden one day,
discussing the youthfulness of senior officers
of the British Army, as compared with those of
the German Army, he confided to me that when
he was ordered to conduct an English Colonel,
he fully expected to see an old and grizzled veteran,
whereas to his astonishment, he found me
younger than himself, who was only a Captain.
I shall never forget how, when I laughingly told
him that I had jumped from Lieutenant to Lieutenant
Colonel in about eight months during the
South African War, he stopped short in the middle
of the pavement, saluted me gravely and
said: "You are Napoleon!" Of course, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
these days, this meteoric flight is quite an everyday
occurrence in our Army!</p>

<p>Among many other interesting things that the
Prussian Captain showed me was their Hall of
Glory, the walls of which are covered with pictures
of famous battles and generals. While
we were there I saw little parties of Prussian
recruits being taken from picture to picture,
guided by veterans. With straightened shoulders
and glowing eye the old soldiers kindled the
enthusiasm of the coming warriors by recounting
to them the glorious and daring deeds performed
by their forefathers on many a well-fought
field.</p>

<p>This, no doubt, is only one of the numerous
carefully thought out schemes of the General
Staff to instil into the German nation the spirit
of military pride and glory.</p>

<p>I paid another visit to Germany shortly before
the present war broke out, and, soon after
my return, I happened to meet in London the
German Military Attaché, Major Renner, who
seemed most anxious to hear from me what my
impressions were. I suppose he wondered if I
had seen much of the vast preparations, which
were even then being made, for the great war
into which Germany has plunged the world.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
Of all my observations the only things I confided
to him (which he noted down as if they
were of great importance!) were that I considered
the abominable type used in German newspapers
and books responsible for the be-spectacled
German; that although their railway stations
were wonderfully clean, yet they were
without a decent platform, and my insular modesty
had been shocked on many occasions by the
amount of German leg I saw when the ladies
clambered into and out of the carriages; and
lastly, that I thought the long and handsome
cloak worn by the officers might be greatly improved
by making a slit at the side, so that the
hilt of the sword might be outside, instead of
inside the cloak, where not only did it make an
unsightly lump, but was hard to get at in case of
urgent need.</p>

<p>A day or two after war was declared, I happened
to be dining in London with Mr. and Mrs.
Walrond. Among the other guests was a Staff
Officer from the War Office, Major R., who is
now a general. Hearing that I had been recently
in Germany, he asked me what I thought
of their chances. I told him that I felt sure that
Germany would have tremendous victories to
begin with, and that I believed her armies would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
get to the gates of Paris, but did not think they
would capture Paris this time; and that, although
it would take us time, we would beat
them eventually, for so long as we held command
of the sea, we were bound to win in the
end.</p>

<p>Some of the guests at this dinner party have
since complimented me on the accuracy of the
first part of my prophecy, and I feel absolutely
convinced that the remainder of my forecast will,
in spite of all bungling, prove equally true, always
provided the Navy is given a free hand,
and allowed to do its work in its own way.</p>

<p>In poor, brave little Belgium also I had every
opportunity given to me by the General Staff to
see their Cavalry at work; and while I was in
Brussels, Colonel Fourcault, commanding the
2nd Guides, gave me the freedom of the barracks,
where I could come and go as I liked. I
became very good friends with the officers of the
regiment, and we had discussions about Cavalry,
its equipment and fighting value. On
being asked for my opinion on the relative value
of the rifle as compared with the lance and sabre,
I unhesitatingly backed the rifle. I saw that
the Belgian Cavalry were armed with a small,
toylike carbine and a heavy sabre, and in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
discussions which we had, I told them that in
my humble opinion they would be well advised
to scrap both and adopt the infantry rifle and a
lighter thrusting sword&mdash;but above all I impressed
upon them to be sure about the rifle, as
the occasions for the use of the <i>arme blanche</i> in
future would be rare, with all due deference to
General von Bernhardi.</p>

<p>I was, of course, looked upon as a Cavalry
leper for expressing such heretical opinions in a
Cavalry mess, but I had my revenge later on,
when Captain Donnay de Casteau of the 2nd
Guides called on me at my club during his stay
in London after poor little Belgium had been
crushed. He came especially to tell me that
those who were left of the regiment often
talked of the unorthodox views I had so strongly
expressed and he said: "We all had to agree
that every word you told us has proved absolutely
true."</p>

<p>While I was in Belgium I went down to the
now famous Mons, and was the guest of the 7th
Chasseurs à Cheval, where I got a thorough insight
into the interior economy of the regiment.</p>

<p>It has always been a profound mystery to
me that our Intelligence did not give Field-Marshal
French earlier information while he was at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
Mons of the fact that large German forces were
marching upon him from the direction of
Tournai. Some strange and fatal inertia must
have fallen both on the French Intelligence and
our own, otherwise it would have been impossible
for a large German army to have got into this
threatening position without information having
been sent to the Commander-in-Chief.</p>

<p>When in Spain I was privileged, owing to
the courtesy of the Madrid War Office, to see
something of the Spanish Army. I cannot say
that I was deeply impressed; there was too much
"<i>Mañana</i>" about it, or in other words, "Wait and
see!" From what I observed I was not at all
surprised to find it crumple up before the Americans
in Cuba. It would, however, be a glorious
thing to be a colonel in the Spanish Army, as
they seemed to be able to do what was right in
their own eyes.</p>

<p>But this was some years ago, and I understand
that the Spanish Army, now that it has
got a brand-new General Staff, is to be completely
reorganised and made into a really efficient
fighting force.</p>

<p>Of course I have many times seen the French
and Italian armies at work and play&mdash;so that
altogether my knowledge of soldiers and soldiering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
is somewhat catholic, and I may therefore
claim to have some little right to criticise the
policy, the strategy, and the tactics of the Gallipoli
campaign.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>

<h3>GENERAL POLICY OF THE DARDANELLES CAMPAIGN</h3>


<p>Many leaders of thought in England, whose
convictions should certainly carry weight, are of
the opinion that the expedition to the Dardanelles
was in itself unsound, and should never
have been undertaken. Now the views of well-known
practical common-sense men should not
be lightly thrust aside, but perhaps as one who
has travelled and read much, and knows the
East and the questions bound up with it fairly
well, I hope I may not appear too presumptuous
if I venture to disagree with those who condemn
the Dardanelles policy.</p>

<p>It must be remembered that although we declared
war on Turkey she had already committed
several hostile acts on our Russian ally,
and had flouted us most outrageously by allowing
the <i>Goeben</i> and <i>Breslau</i> the freedom and
protection of her waters and the resources of her
arsenals.</p>

<p>Of course the escape of these two ships is one
of the most extraordinary bungles of the war,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
which it is to be hoped will be carefully gone into
at some future time, and the responsible culprit
brought to book, for on his head probably rests
the blood of the countless dead in Gallipoli.</p>

<p>I have reason to think that it is more than
doubtful whether the mischievous activity of
Enver Pasha and his satellites would have been
sufficient to induce the Turkish nation to commit
an act of war against either ourselves or
Russia, but for the presence at the gates of Constantinople
of these powerful German warships.</p>

<p>Our ally having been attacked and we ourselves
flouted it became necessary for us, if we
meant to uphold our prestige in the East, to declare
war on Turkey.</p>

<p>A successful war against the Ottoman Empire
had immense possibilities in it; the way to
Russia would be opened, guns and munitions
would have streamed in to her through the Bosphorus,
while wheat for ourselves and our allies
would have streamed out&mdash;but there was a great
deal more than this at stake, as I shall point out.</p>

<p>It was well known to the Foreign Office that
unless we showed a strong hand in the Near
East, some of the Balkan States, who were even
then trembling in the balance, would in all probability
link their fortunes with those of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
enemy. These wavering States wished to join
the Allies if they saw a reasonable chance of the
Allies' success. On the other hand Austria,
backed up by the might of Germany, was at
their gates, and with Belgium as an object lesson
they feared for their country. What therefore
could have been more calculated to gain
them to our side than a smashing blow which
would crumple up Turkey and give us direct
communication with Russia? Had we succeeded
(and we ought to have succeeded) it is
certain that Greece and Rumania would now be
fighting on our side; the astute Ferdinand would
have seen on which side his bread was buttered,
and have either kept Bulgaria neutral, or made
common cause with the Allies; and those unfortunate
little States, Serbia and Montenegro,
would not have been betrayed and ground to
dust.</p>

<p>The fall of Constantinople would once more
have been a great epoch-making event, which
would have changed the course of the world's
history, for with its fall our victorious army,
hand in hand with Russia, would have made a
triumphant march through the Balkans, where
every State would then have rallied to our side.</p>

<p>This allied flood would number between two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
and three millions of men, and with this irresistible
force we would have burst upon the plains
of Hungary and on to the heart of the Empire.
Such an advance is not new to history, as the
Turks themselves, when in the zenith of their
power, overran Austria-Hungary and were only
denied the domination of Europe under the very
walls of Vienna itself, where, as everybody
knows, they were defeated by John Sobiesky.
No modern Sobiesky would have been found
strong enough to deprive us of our prey, and
with the fall of Vienna Austria would have been
crushed, and the war would soon have come to a
victorious end.</p>

<p>Even if we did not penetrate quite so far, the
very fact of such a large army advancing from
the south and east would have drawn an immense
number of the enemy's troops from the
Eastern and Western fronts, which would have
given the Russians, the French and ourselves an
opportunity of smashing through on those
fronts and between us crushing Germany.</p>

<p>Yes, undoubtedly the fall of Constantinople
was of vital importance, and for once our politicians
were right.</p>

<p>In addition to our material gains in Europe,
our prestige throughout the East would have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
reached a pinnacle such as it has never yet attained,
and there would have been no such nuts
for us to crack as the Egyptian, Persian, or
Mesopotamian questions.</p>

<p>Germany would be completely hemmed in
and the strangling grip of our fleet would have
been irresistible when this last link with the outer
world had been severed.</p>

<p>Germany's wheat supply from Rumania, copper
from Serbia, cottons, fats and other vital
products from Turkey would be cut off, and
economic life in the Central Empires would in a
very short time have been made intolerable.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>

<h3>STRATEGY AND TACTICS OF THE DARDANELLES
CAMPAIGN</h3>


<p>Now, having recognised the tremendous issues
which were involved in the fall of Constantinople,
it may be asked did the Government provide
a weapon sufficiently strong to carry out
their policy? In my humble opinion they did,&mdash;if
only the weapon had been rightly handled.</p>

<p>Of course, whoever is to blame for the Bedlamite
policy of the first disastrous attempts by
the Navy alone bears a heavy responsibility.
Beyond knocking the entrance forts to pieces, all
that this premature attack by the Fleet effected
was to give the Turks ample warning of our intentions,
of which they took full advantage by
making the Gallipoli Peninsula an almost impregnable
fortress and the Dardanelles a network
of mines.</p>

<p>But even this grave initial blunder could have
been rectified, if only sound strategy had been
adopted in the combined naval and military attack
on the Dardanelles.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
The problem before the strategists was, of
course, to get through to Constantinople with
the Fleet, and this could only be done by forcing
the Narrows, a strip of the Dardanelles heavily
fortified and only a mile wide. It was therefore
necessary to reduce the forts guarding the Narrows,
and with an army to hold the heights on
Gallipoli dominating the Dardanelles, so as to
ensure the safety of the Fleet.</p>

<p>Having command of the seas gave us the
choice of launching the attack at any point we
chose on the Turkish coast; therefore the Turks
were at the great disadvantage of having to divide
their forces into several parts, so as to guard
such points as they thought might possibly be
attacked.</p>

<p>It was known that there was a Turkish army
on the Asiatic side, at the south of Chanak, the
principal Fort on the Asiatic shore of the Narrows;
also that the Bulair lines, some forty miles
from the extremity of the Peninsula, were
strongly fortified and held; that a strong force
was entrenched on the southern portion of the
Peninsula in the neighbourhood of Cape Helles;
and, in addition, that there was yet another
Turkish army holding the heights on the Ægean
at, or near, a point now known as Anzac.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
Now, if any one will take the trouble to study
the map, which will be found at the end of this
book, he will see that the key to the Narrows is
that portion of the Gallipoli Peninsula which
extends across from Anzac on the Ægean,
through the heights of Sari Bair, to the Dardanelles.</p>

<p>If, therefore, instead of dividing the Mediterranean
Expeditionary Force (which unfortunately
was the plan adopted) and having it held
up or destroyed in detail, the whole force had
been thrown in its entirety at this point, and a
vigorous sledge-hammer blow delivered, I feel
absolutely confident that a crowning victory
would have been gained and the expedition
would have been a glorious success.</p>

<p>Of the four Turkish armies the only one that
could have opposed a sudden vigorous thrust at
the key position was the one at and near Anzac,
and this force we could have swept aside and
crumpled up before any of the others could possibly
have come to its assistance.</p>

<p>That the Expeditionary Force could have been
landed here is proved by the fact that the two
Australian and New Zealand Divisions did land
here, and these dauntless men, by themselves, almost
succeeded in taking Sari Bair and getting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
astride the Peninsula. For eight months they
held their end up, and more than held it up,
against overwhelming odds. Had they been
backed up at the time of the first landing on
April 25th, 1915, by the "incomparable 29th
Division," one of the best the British Army has
ever seen, together with the two French Divisions,
with their hundred celebrated .75 guns,
and the Royal Naval Division, no Turkish
troops at that time in the neighbourhood could
for a moment have stood up against them, and
with our grip once established on the Peninsula
nothing could have shaken us off&mdash;not all the
soldiers in the Ottoman Empire.</p>

<p>Every Turk on the southern portion of Gallipoli
must inevitably have fallen into our hands
within a few days, for it was well known that
they were but ill supplied with ammunition and
food. There was no chance of escape for them,
for our Fleet commanded all the waters round
Gallipoli up to the very Narrows themselves,
and nothing could possibly have gained the Asiatic
shore; while anything attempting to cross
at the Narrows would have been inevitably sunk
by the artillery which we would have mounted
on the dominating heights of the Peninsula.
No help could reach them from Constantinople,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
for the same reason, and it would have been in
vain for them to have endeavoured to break
through our lines, as was proved over and over
again in the many determined but futile assaults
they made on us in Gallipoli, when they were invariably
hurled back with enormous losses.</p>

<p>Once astride the Peninsula, where our length
of front would be less than seven miles, with
over six men to the yard holding it, nothing
could have shaken off our strangling hold. It
would only then have been a question of directing
the fire of the heavy naval guns on the Forts
in the Narrows, which would, of course, be done
by direct observation, and these strongholds
would have been pounded to dust by the <i>Queen
Elizabeth</i> and other battleships within a week,
thus leaving open the road to Constantinople.
Such might have been the glorious ending of the
Gallipoli campaign if only sound strategical and
tactical methods had been employed.</p>

<p>It is a thousand pities that this plan of operations
was not adopted, for with such proved
commanders as General d'Amade, General
Birdwood and General Hunter-Weston&mdash;thrusters
all&mdash;and with such incomparable men,
there would have been no "fatal inertia" to
chronicle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
It must be remembered that at the time of
this landing on April 25th, the Turks had had
but little time to organise their defences and it
would then have been a much easier task to have
seized the heights of Sari Bair than when the
attempt was made with raw troops later on in
August, an attempt which, even with all the
drawbacks chronicled against it, came within an
ace of being a success.</p>

<p>Another great advantage was that the weather,
when we landed in April, was much cooler;
there was also an ample rainfall, so that there
would have been no difficulty about drinking-water,
a lack of which in August proved fatal
to the attempt made in that hot, dry month.
We did not, of course, rely upon a chance rainfall
at the time of our landing, for, as I shall
show later on, ample provision had been made
for carrying and supplying water, at all events
for the 29th Division.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, such a plan of campaign as I
have outlined was not put into execution. Instead,
the force was split up into no less than
nine parts, and practically destroyed in detail,
or brought to a standstill by the Turks.</p>

<p>The Australian and New Zealand Divisions
landed at Anzac, the key position; the 29th Division<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
beat themselves to death attacking six different
and almost impregnable positions on the
toe of the Peninsula, where, I dare to say, not a
single man ought ever to have been landed; in
addition to the opposition they met with in Gallipoli
they were subjected to a rain of shells
from Asia, not only at the time of landing but
throughout the whole time we wasted in occupying
this utterly (from a military point of view)
useless end of the Peninsula.</p>

<p>The Royal Naval Division was sent somewhere
in the direction of the Bulair Lines, where
it effected nothing, and the two French Divisions
made an onslaught on the Asiatic coast,
which, although well conceived and most gallantly
put into execution, helped the main cause
not at all. Of course, they were invaluable in
preventing the Asiatic guns from firing on the
29th Division at the time of the landing, but
then this Division should of course have been
landed at Anzac, where they would have been
out of range of those guns. Whatever Turkish
force opposed the French at Kum Kale could
never have got across the Dardanelles in time to
have opposed our landing at or near Anzac.</p>

<p>If it had been thought necessary to make demonstrations
on the Asiatic coast, at the toe of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
the Peninsula, and at the Bulair Lines, this could
have been done equally well by sending the
empty transports to those places, escorted by a
few gunboats, and thus have held the Turks in
position by making a pretence at throwing
troops ashore at those points.</p>

<p>Of course, it is easy to be wise after the event,
but I never did see, and never could see, the
point of dividing our force and landing on the
southern part of Gallipoli, for, once we had
got astride the Peninsula from Anzac to the
Narrows, all the Turks to the south of us must
have fallen into our mouths, like ripe plums.</p>

<p>Napoleon has placed it on record that it is
the besetting sin of British commanders to fritter
away their forces by dividing them and so
laying themselves open to be defeated in detail.
It would appear that we have not even yet taken
Napoleon's maxim to heart, for if ever there
was an occasion on which it was absolutely vital
to keep the whole force intact for a mighty blow,
it was on that fateful Sunday morning, April
25th, 1915, when one concentrated thrust from
Anzac to the Narrows would have undoubtedly
placed in our hands the key of the Ottoman
Empire.</p>

<p>The Dardanelles campaign will go down to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
history as the greatest failure sustained by British
arms, and yet no more glorious deeds have
ever been performed by any army in the world.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<h3>FORMATION OF THE ZION MULE CORPS</h3>


<p>From the days of my youth I have always been
a keen student of the Jewish people, their history,
laws and customs. Even as a boy I spent
the greater part of my leisure hours poring over
the Bible, especially that portion of the Old
Testament which chronicles battles, murders,
and sudden deaths, little thinking that this Biblical
knowledge would ever be of any practical
value in after life.</p>

<p>It was strange, therefore, that I, so imbued
with Jewish traditions, should have been drawn
to the land where the Pharaohs had kept the
Children of Israel in bondage for over four hundred
years; and it was still more strange that I
should have arrived in Egypt just at the psychological
moment when General Sir John Maxwell,
the Commander-in-Chief, was looking out
for a suitable officer to raise and command a
Jewish unit.</p>

<p>Now, such a thing as a Jewish unit had been
unknown in the annals of the world for some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
two thousand years&mdash;since the days of the Maccabees,
those heroic Sons of Israel who fought
so valiantly, and for a time so successfully, to
wrest Jerusalem from the grasp of the Roman
legions.</p>

<p>It had happened that there had come down to
Egypt out of Palestine many hundreds of people
who had fled from thence to escape the wrath
of the Turks. These people were of Russian
nationality but of Jewish faith, and many of
them strongly desired to band themselves together
into a fighting host and place their lives
at the disposal of England, whom the Jews have
recognised as their friend and protector from
time immemorial. Indeed, by many it is held
that the British people are none other than some
of the lost tribes; moreover, we have taken so
much of Jewish national life for our own, mainly
owing to our strong Biblical leanings, that the
Jews can never feel while with us that they are
among entire strangers.</p>

<p>Now these people having made known their
wishes to the Commander-in-Chief, he, in a
happy moment of inspiration, saw how much it
would benefit England, morally and materially,
to have bound up with our fortunes a Jewish
fighting unit.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
The next thing to be done was to find a suitable
British officer to command this unique
force, and at the time of my arrival in Cairo,
General Maxwell had already applied for "a
tactful thruster" to be chosen from among the
officers of the Indian Brigade then doing duty
on the Suez Canal.</p>

<p>My opportune arrival, however, coupled with
a strong backing from an old friend, Major-General
Sir Alexander Godley, decided him to
offer me the command.</p>

<p>It certainly was curious that the General's
choice should have fallen upon me, for, of course,
he knew nothing of my knowledge of Jewish
history, or of my sympathy for the Jewish race.
When, as a boy, I eagerly devoured the records
of the glorious deeds of Jewish military captains
such as Joshua, Joab, Gideon and Judas Maccabæus,
I little dreamt that one day I, myself,
would, in a small way, be a captain of a host of
the Children of Israel!</p>

<p>On the 19th March, 1915, I was appointed to
my unique command, and on the same day I left
Cairo for Alexandria, where all the refugees
from Palestine were gathered together as the
guests of the British Government.</p>

<p>On my arrival there, I lost no time in getting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
into touch with the leading members of the Jewish
Community, and I found the Grand Rabbi
(Professor Raphael della Pergola), Mr. Edgard
Suares, Mr. Isaac Aghion, Mr. Piccioto
and others, all most sympathetic and eager to assist
me in every possible way. Nor must I forget
that an impetus was given to the recruiting
by the receipt of a heartening cablegram from
Mr. Israel Zangwill, whose name is a household
word to all Zionists.</p>

<p>On the 23rd March, 1915, the young Jewish
volunteers were paraded for the purpose of
being "sworn in" at the refugee camp at Gibbari.</p>

<p>It was a most imposing ceremony; the Grand
Rabbi, who officiated, stood in a commanding
position overlooking the long rows of serious and
intelligent-looking lads. He explained to them
the meaning of an oath, and the importance of
keeping it, and impressed upon them that the
honour of Israel rested in their hands. He then
asked them to repeat after him, word for word,
the oath of military obedience to myself and
such officers as should be appointed over them,
and with great solemnity, and in perfect unison,
the men, with uplifted hands, repeated the
formula.</p>

<p>The Grand Rabbi then delivered a stirring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
address to the new soldiers, in which he compared
them to their forefathers who had been led out
of Egypt by Moses, and at the end he turned to
me and presented me to them as their modern
leader.</p>

<p>This memorable and historic scene aroused
the greatest enthusiasm among the throng of
Jewish sympathisers who had come to witness
this interesting ceremony.</p>

<p>The sanctioned strength of the Corps in officers
and men was roughly 500, with 20 riding
horses for officers and the senior non-commissioned
officers, and 750 pack mules for transport
work.</p>

<p>To assist me in commanding the Corps, I had
five British and eight Jewish officers.</p>

<p>The Grand Rabbi of Alexandria, a most
pious, earnest and learned man, was appointed
our honourary chaplain.</p>

<p>I was extremely fortunate in my British officers,
for although they had never served in the
Army, or knew anything about military routine,
yet they were all practical men, and, after all,
at least in war-time, everything depends upon
having officers with plenty of common sense.</p>

<p>I had Mr. D. Gye, who was lent to me from
the Egyptian Ministry of Finance; Messrs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
Carver and Maclaren, expert bankers and cotton-brokers;
and the two brothers, Messrs. C.
and I. Rolo, whose business house is known not
only in Egypt, but also in the greater part of the
world.</p>

<p>I was, indeed, lucky in getting such good men
who loyally seconded me in everything and
quickly mastered the details necessary for the
running of the Corps; nor did they spare themselves
during those four weeks of slavery which
we together put in while getting the men ready
for active service.</p>

<p>In addition to these British officers, I had, as
I have already stated, eight Jewish officers.
One of these, Captain Trumpledor, had already
been a soldier in the Russian Army, had been
through the siege of Port Arthur, where he had
lost his left arm, and had been given the Order
of St. George (in gold) by the Czar for his gallantry
and zeal during that celebrated siege.</p>

<p>Among the N. C. O.'s and men I had every
conceivable trade and calling; highly educated
men like Mr. Gorodisky, a Professor at the
Lycée in Alexandria, and afterwards promoted
to commissioned rank; students of Law, Medicine,
and Divinity; mechanics of all kinds, of
whom I found the tinsmith the most useful.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
Even a Rabbi was to be found in the ranks, who
was able to administer consolation to the dying
and burial rites to those who were struck down
when death came amongst us before the enemy
in Gallipoli. I also discovered among the enlisted
soldiers a fully-qualified medical man, Dr.
Levontin, whom I appointed our surgeon after
having obtained permission to form a medical
unit.</p>

<p>Through the kindness and practical sympathy
of Surgeon-General Ford, the Director of Medical
Services in Egypt, I soon had a hospital in
being, with its tents, beds, orderlies and sanitary
section.</p>

<p>Altogether we were a little family unit complete
within ourselves.</p>

<p>I divided the Corps, for purposes of interior
economy, into four troops, each with a British
and Jewish officer in command; each troop was
again divided into four sections with a sergeant
in charge, and each section was again subdivided
into subsections with a corporal in charge;
and so the chain of responsibility went down to
the lively mule himself&mdash;and, by the shades of
Jehoshaphat, couldn't some of those mules
kick!! Sons of Belial would be a very mild
name for them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
One of the first things to be attended to was
to find a suitable place upon which to train the
men and mules. I eventually secured an excellent
site at Wardian from Brigadier-General
Stanton, then commanding at Alexandria.
Here we pitched our tents and went into camp
on April 2nd, 1915.</p>

<p>It was no light task to get uniforms, equipment,
arms, ammunition, etc., for such a body
of men at short notice, but in a very few days I
had my men all under canvas, my horses and
hundreds of mules pegged out in lines, and the
men marching up and down, drilling to Hebrew
words of command.</p>

<p>Never since the days of Judas Maccabæus had
such sights and sounds been seen and heard in a
military camp; indeed, had that redoubtable
General paid us a surprise visit, he might have
imagined himself with his own legions, because
here he would have found a great camp with the
tents of the Children of Israel pitched round
about; he would have heard the Hebrew tongue
spoken on all sides, and seen a little host of the
Sons of Judah drilling to the same words of
command that he himself used to those gallant
soldiers who so nobly fought against Rome
under his banner; he would even have heard the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
plaintive soul-stirring music of the Maccabæan
hymn chanted by the men as they marched
through the camp.</p>

<p>Although Hebrew was the language generally
used, nevertheless I drilled the men in English
also, as it was fitting that they should understand
English words of command.</p>

<p>The men were armed with excellent rifles,
bayonets and ammunition, all captured from the
Turks when they made their futile assault on
the Suez Canal.</p>

<p>For our badge we had the "Magin David," an
exact reproduction of the Shield of David, such
as he perhaps used when, as the Champion of
Israel, he went out to fight Goliath of Gath.</p>

<p>It may, perhaps, be wondered why we were
equipped with rifles, bayonets and ammunition,
but this is one of the unique things about this
unique Corps that, although it was only a Mule
Corps, yet it was a fighting unit, and of this, of
course, the men were all very proud.</p>

<p>When we were getting our equipment from
Cairo, I left Lieutenant Carver there to draw
it from the Arsenal in the Citadel and bring it to
Alexandria, telling him that above all things he
must never lose sight of the gear, for if he did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
it would certainly be appropriated by somebody
else.</p>

<p>Among other things, he was drawing pack
saddlery for our mules, which I was anxious to
obtain quickly in order to go on with the training
of the men.</p>

<p>Carver saw the pack saddles safely put into
the railway wagons at Cairo, saw the wagons
locked, sealed, and consigned to me at Alexandria,
but the moment they arrived at Gibbari
a prowling marauder from the Royal Naval Division,
happening to spot the wagons and see
what they contained by the ticket on the outside,
induced the "Gippy" station-master to deliver
them to him, and before I even knew that they
had arrived at the station, all my pack saddles
were safely on board ship and on their way to
Suez with the Naval Division!</p>

<p>I tracked down the culprit, who not only had
to disgorge but, I understand, to pay for the
transit of the saddlery back to Alexandria; although
this may have been a lesson for the buccaneer
and might for the future make him
"tread lightly" like Agag, yet it did not compensate
me for the annoying delay caused by this
unblushing robbery.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
The work of training went on from dawn to
dark, as officers and men had to be taught everything
from the ground-floor up. Not a moment
could be wasted. Drilling and parades were the
order of the day; horses and mules had to be exercised,
fed and watered three times a day; the
men had to be taught how to saddle and unsaddle
them, load and unload packs; they had
also to be instructed in the use of the rifle and
bayonet. Camp kitchens had to be constructed.
Horse and mule lines had to be swept and
garnished, tents cleaned out, etc., and a thousand
and one things crammed into the day's
work.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the zeal and energy which
we all put forth to get the Corps ready, yet had
it not been for the sympathy of General Maxwell,
and the active help of his Staff Officer, Captain
Holdich, I fear it would have been impossible
for us to have made the rapid progress we
did in such a short space of time. I think it
must be, in its way, a record to form, equip and
train a unit of this description and have it actually
in the firing line, and doing useful work
there, in a little over three weeks!</p>

<p>It speaks volumes for the keenness of the men,
and for the intelligent way in which they imbibed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
the knowledge which was crammed into
them in such feverish haste.</p>

<p>After a couple of weeks' training we were specially
favoured by a notification that the Commander-in-Chief
of the Mediterranean Expeditionary
Force, General Sir Ian Hamilton,
would inspect us. It was with mixed feelings
that I received this order, for, of course, it meant
a special parade, and also that the whole of the
routine of drills, etc., would have to be knocked
out for one afternoon, and as every moment was
precious this was no light matter.</p>

<p>The Commander-in-Chief came and made his
inspection a few days before he sailed for Mudros,
and was most complimentary on the workmanlike
appearance which the Corps presented.</p>

<p>I was delighted to receive about this time a
notification that my Corps should be held in readiness
to embark for the front at an early date.</p>

<p>A few days before we embarked I had the
privilege of partaking of the Feast of the Passover
with the Grand Rabbi and his family at
Alexandria. It will readily be understood with
what feelings of deep interest I took part in the
various rites. I seemed to be living again in the
days of Moses when, in this very same land and
not very far distant, the Children of Israel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
sprinkled their doorposts with the blood of the
lamb, and partook of the Feast with their loins
girded, their staves in their hands, on the eve of
their departure from the land of bondage. I
had to ask myself if it were all a dream. It
seemed so strange that I should be partaking of
the same Feast four thousand years later on the
eve of my departure, with a number of the Children
of Israel, to wander and suffer anew in another
wilderness.</p>

<p>Every bit of the ceremony was gone through,
the eating of unleavened bread and bitter herbs,
the drinking of wine and vinegar, each symbolical
of the trials to be gone through by the
Israelites before reaching the Promised Land.
All had its charm for me, and when my hostess
came round with a towel and ewer and basin, to
wash my hands at certain times during the Feast,
it visualised to me as nothing else could have
done those far away days when Pharaoh ruled
the land.</p>

<p>The Grand Rabbi had his three handsome
boys at his knees, the youngest a living image of
one of Murillo's cherubs. He recounted to
them in Hebrew the story of their forefathers'
sojourn in Egypt, and their subsequent wanderings
in the wilderness, as no doubt the same story<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
has been told by the Fathers of Israel to their
children for countless generations. "And thou
shalt show thy son in that day, saying: This is
done because of that which the Lord did unto
me when I came forth from Egypt."</p>

<p>During our training period in Alexandria,
we were the recipients of many acts of kindness
from the community there. The men were
given gifts by a committee of ladies, composed
of the Baronne Felix de Menasce, Madame
Rolo, Madame Israel, Mesdames E. and J.
Goar, and a host of others.</p>

<p>We had a last big parade, and marched from
Wardian Camp for some three miles through
the streets of Alexandria to the Synagogue, to
receive the final blessing of the Grand Rabbi.
The spacious Temple, in the street of the
Prophet Daniel, was on this occasion filled to its
utmost capacity. The Grand Rabbi exhorted
the men to bear themselves like good soldiers and
in times of difficulty and danger to call upon the
Name of the Lord who would deliver them out
of their adversity. His final benediction was
most solemn and impressive, and will never be
forgotten by those who were privileged to be
present.</p>

<p>A couple of days later we received orders to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
embark for Gallipoli with all possible speed.
We therefore strained every nerve to get aboard
in good time and in ship-shape order.</p>

<p>The Corps was divided into two parts, the
Headquarters and two troops going on H. M.
Transport <i>Hymettus</i>, and two troops on H. M.
Transport <i>Anglo-Egyptian</i>.</p>

<p>It was no easy task in so short a time to get
men, mules, horses, forage, equipment, etc.,
from Wardian Camp to the docks, a distance of
two or three miles, and we worked practically
all day and all night slinging horses and mules
on board, tying them up in their stalls, and
storing baggage and equipment, etc., in the
holds. Thirty days' forage for the animals and
rations for the men were also put under the
hatches.</p>

<p>As one of our duties in Gallipoli would be to
supply the troops in the trenches with water, an
Alexandrian firm had been ordered to make
some thousands of kerosene oil tins, the manufacture
of which is a local industry. Wooden
frames had also been ordered to fit on to the pack
saddles, so as to enable the mules to carry the
tins. Each mule was to carry four of these full
of water, equal to sixteen gallons. The tins arrived
in good time, but the wooden frames were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
late in delivery, and held us up over a day and a
half beyond our time in Alexandria Docks.</p>

<p>At last, having obtained delivery of the indispensable
wooden crates, we joyfully steamed out
of harbour <i>en route</i> for Gallipoli on the 17th
April, 1915.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>

<h3>ARRIVAL AT LEMNOS</h3>


<p>We were not the only troops on board the
<i>Hymettus</i>. There were some gunner officers of
siege batteries, and some officers and men of the
Royal Army Medical Corps; a stationary hospital
with the necessary staff of the R. A. M. C.
men, as well as some other odds and ends for
various units of the Expeditionary Force already
at Lemnos. I happened to be the Senior Officer
on board, so was Officer Commanding the troops
during the voyage.</p>

<p>I would like to mention here that the captain,
chief officer, and chief engineer, of the <i>Hymettus</i>
were most helpful in every possible way,
and I am glad to be able to pay this little tribute
to them for all their kindness to us while we were
aboard.</p>

<p>One of the most interesting of our fellow voyagers
was Captain Edmunds, R. A. M. C., one
of the medical officers in charge of the Australian
Hospital stores. He had been taken prisoner
by the Germans while attending to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
wounded during the retreat from Mons, and he
told us many tales of his bad treatment at their
hands. He was kept a prisoner for a considerable
time, but finally was released owing to some
interchange of medical officers between England
and Germany.</p>

<p>The voyage to Lemnos was quite uneventful.
We, fortunately, missed the Turkish torpedo-boat
that tried to sink the <i>Manitou</i>, a transport
just ahead of us. This troopship had quite an
adventurous time. The torpedo-boat stopped
her and the Turkish commander, with rare humanity,
called out that he would give them ten
minutes to save themselves. I am told that
there was a German officer on the bridge who
was heard quarrelling with the Turkish commander
for being so lenient.</p>

<p>The <i>Manitou</i> lowered her boats in a very great
hurry, and unluckily a couple of them tilted up,
with the result that some fifty or sixty men were
drowned. At the end of the time limit the Turks
discharged a torpedo. Now when this missile is
first fired it takes a dive before it steadies itself
on its course, and as the two vessels were close together,
luckily for the <i>Manitou</i>, the dive took the
torpedo well under her keel; the same thing happened
when the second and third torpedoes were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
launched; finally, as the Turk was about to open
fire and sink the troopship with his guns, a British
destroyer raced up at full speed and chased
the marauder on to the rocks of a Grecian isle,
where the Turkish vessel became a total wreck.</p>

<p>The training of the Zionists went steadily forward
on board ship, for many of the men were
still quite raw&mdash;in fact, I recruited several on
the ship a few hours before we sailed. The
mules and horses took up a great deal of time
every day, but we never had one sick or sorry;
and I may say here that we never lost one from
sickness all the time we were in Gallipoli, which
must, I think, be a record.</p>

<p>On April 20th we arrived at Lemnos and
anchored just inside the entrance of Mudros
harbour in a blinding wind and rain storm. It
will be remembered that when the gods quarrelled,
Jove hurled Vulcan out of Olympus on
to Lemnos, where he established a forge underground.
The morning following our arrival,
one of the transports to windward of us began
to drag her anchor, so our captain weighed immediately,
fearing a collision, and we sailed right
through the fleet to the opposite end of the
great land-locked harbour. Never in all my
life had I seen such a mighty armada of battleships,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
cruisers, destroyers, transports, etc. The
<i>Queen Elizabeth</i> was there, looking for all the
world like a floating fortress. There were some
quaint French battleships, while the Russian
cruiser <i>Askold</i> caused universal attention, owing
to her five slim funnels. With the soldier's customary
knack of giving appropriate names, the
<i>Askold</i> was known throughout the Fleet as "the
packet of Woodbines." Our Zionists, as we
sailed by, astonished her crew by bandying
words with them in Russian.</p>

<p>Our trip up the harbour was not to end without
adventure, for, on turning round to cast
anchor, our ship ran aground on a mudbank.
Here we stuck fast and all the King's horses and
all the King's men failed to tug us off again.
Time after time naval officers came along with
tug-boats and vessels of various kinds which
strained to release us, but each attempt was a
hopeless failure.</p>

<p>On the afternoon of the 23rd, I got somewhat
of a shock on being informed that the Zion Mule
Corps was to be divided. The half on the <i>Hymettus</i>
was to go with the 29th Division, and the
other half, those already on board the <i>Anglo-Egyptian</i>,
were to be sent with the Australians
and New Zealanders. Of course, this arrangement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
would have been all right if these three Divisions
had been landed at the same place, but
as they were to disembark some dozen miles
apart it would be impossible for me to keep an
eye on both halves of the Corps, and I greatly
feared that the half away from my own personal
supervision would not prove a success, for officers,
N. C. O.'s and men were entirely new to
soldiering, and it was too much to expect that
they could go straight into the firing line, after
only some three weeks' training, and come
through the ordeal triumphantly without an experienced
commander.</p>

<p>I, therefore, after many vain endeavours to
get away, hailed a passing launch, which, as a
great favour, put me on board the staff ship, the
<i>Arcadian</i>, where I had an interview with the
Deputy Quartermaster-General, and begged of
him not to divide the Corps, as I feared that
those away from my control would prove but a
broken reed. He told me, however, that it was
impossible to alter matters, and that the Australians
and New Zealanders had had practically
no transport, except what my Corps would supply,
and that in any case we would not be separated
for more than four days, because if we
could not crush the Turks in that time, between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
the two forces, we were going to give up the attempt
and return to our ships.</p>

<p>Well, we did not crush the Turks in the four
days, and, having failed, it was not so easy to get
away, and the result was that, owing to lack
of experience, and mismanagement in the handling
of them, the two troops with the Australians,
after a couple of weeks' service with that
force, were sent back to Alexandria, without any
reference to me, and there disbanded.</p>

<p>As there were no boats available, I had the
greatest difficulty in getting away from the
<i>Arcadian</i>, and it was only after wasting many
valuable hours and meeting with many rebuffs,
that I eventually got a kind-hearted sailor to
give me a lift back to the <i>Hymettus</i>. A few
steam launches were badly needed to enable commanding
officers to go aboard the staff ship to
discuss with the chiefs of the various departments
such items as can only be settled satisfactorily
at a personal interview.</p>

<p>I must say that I was not at all pleased with
our position on the mudbank, where, in spite of
all efforts to move us, we still remained stuck.
In the first place, I feared that we would be
unable to get away with the rest of the transports
on the morning of the 25th, the date fixed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
for the great attack, and even if by chance another
vessel could be found for us, it would mean
transhipping all the men, horses, mules, baggage,
forage and equipment, which would be an
immense labour in an open harbour like Mudros,
where it is often blowing half a gale. It is no
wonder that, as each attempt at hauling off the
<i>Hymettus</i> failed, I grew more and more anxious
as to our ultimate chance of getting away in
time to see the start of the great fight in Gallipoli.</p>

<p>At last, on the 24th, the naval officers engaged
on the work gave up all further attempts
to haul us off, and reported the task as hopeless&mdash;at
any rate until everything was removed
from the ship. In the course of an hour I received
a signal from the Deputy Quartermaster-General
to tranship all my corps, stores, etc.,
from the <i>Hymettus</i> to the <i>Dundrennon</i>, a transport
lying half a mile or more away. On receipt
of this message I signalled back and asked for
tugs and lighters to enable us to effect the
transfer, but, although my signallers endeavoured
for hours to attract the attention of those
on the staff ship, I entirely failed to get any
reply. I finally tried to extort a response of
some sort by sending an ire-raising message to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
the effect that on investigation, I found that
many of the men and mules could not swim!
But my sarcasm was wasted, for the <i>Arcadian</i>
remained dumb.</p>

<p>This failure in the signalling arrangements
was very marked all through the two or three
days we spent at Lemnos. It was practically
impossible to get any message through, and one
felt completely cut off from all communication
with the staff ship. There were no arrangements
for getting about in the harbour. The
ship's small boats would have been swamped in
the heavy sea, and it was practically impossible
to secure a launch.</p>

<p>This failure, together with the wretched signalling
arrangements, gave me serious qualms,
and I could not help wondering if the muddle
ceased here, or did it extend to other and more
grave matters which would imperil the success
of the expedition?</p>

<p>All day long I was anxiously on the look-out
for a tug and lighters to enable me to tranship
to the <i>Dundrennon</i>, and at last, at about 6 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span>,
I saw a little trawler, towing a string of half a
dozen lighters, making her way up the harbour
towards us. In a few minutes they were alongside
and made fast to the <i>Hymettus</i>, but, alas!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
I soon discovered that, although the lighters
were for us, the tug was about to sail away
again. The only order the commander had received
was to bring the lighters alongside and
make them fast to the <i>Hymettus</i>, and there his
task ended. This was a blow to me, for I felt
that, if the little <i>Jessie</i> went off, I and my Corps
would be left high and dry on the Lemnos mud,
while the rest of the Expedition sailed off next
morning on the great adventure! Luckily, the
commander of the <i>Jessie</i> was a friend of the Captain's
and came on board for a yarn. After a
few moments I followed him to the Captain's
cabin and, on being introduced, found that he
was Mr. A. R. Murley. I soon discovered that
he was a most exceptional man in every way,
and a sailor to his finger tips. He had been
Chief Officer on board a large liner, but had resigned
his post to volunteer his services to the
Admiralty for the war, and, although the position
he now held as skipper of the <i>Jessie</i> was a
very small one compared with his last charge,
yet, as he sportingly said, what did it matter so
long as he was usefully doing his bit?&mdash;and I believe
he was as proud of the <i>Jessie</i> as if she had
been a liner or a battleship.</p>

<p>I used all my eloquence on Mr. Murley,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
pointed out what a desperate position I was in,
and said that if he did not come to my aid we
would, indeed, be hopelessly stranded. The
Captain of the <i>Hymettus</i>, who, by the way, was
naturally very much upset at having struck this
uncharted mudbank, ably seconded my appeal,
and although Murley had been working from
dawn and had intended to return to his depot
to lay in stores of coal, water and oil, to enable
him to start with the expedition at five o'clock
in the morning, he agreed to work for me
throughout the night.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>

<h3>A STRENUOUS NIGHT</h3>


<p>Having once obtained Murley's consent I flew
off and got officers and men told off in reliefs,
some to work on the loading up of the lighters,
others to go with the mules to the <i>Dundrennon</i>
and remain there to ship and stow away
each load as it came over during the night.</p>

<p>There were six lighters, and as soon as three
were filled, Murley got the little <i>Jessie</i> hitched
on and towed them off to the <i>Dundrennon</i>.
It was a joy to watch the masterly way in
which he handled his tug and man&oelig;uvred the
tow of lighters into the exact position where
they were required alongside the <i>Dundrennon</i>.
Never did I see an error of judgment made, and
everything that Murley had to do went like
clockwork. He had a clear and pleasant word
of command, which rang out like a bell, and although
he was "a hustler" his men never resented
it; first of all, because they knew he was
top-hole at his job and, secondly, because he
was extraordinarily tactful. Tow after tow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
went back and forth throughout the night&mdash;three
full lighters to the <i>Dundrennon</i> and three
empty ones back to the <i>Hymettus</i>&mdash;and didn't
we just hustle those mules into the boats, and
didn't they kick and bite as they felt the slings
go round them to hoist them aloft! It would
have taken us too long had we only slung
one mule at a time, so we hoisted them in couples!
The comical sight the brace of mules
presented, as they were whipped off their legs
and swung up into the gloom, can well be imagined.
They kicked and plunged as they were
passed over the side and lowered down into the
inky murkiness of the lighters, where they were
caught and secured at much risk by men waiting
there for the purpose. Heaven only knows
how they escaped injury, for they had a very
rough time of it before they were comfortably
stowed away in their new quarters on the
<i>Dundrennon</i>. I was quite prepared to hear of
several casualties among both men and mules,
but the mule is a hardy beast, and the Zionist
can stand a lot of knocking about, and we had
not a single man or animal injured.</p>

<p>We were exceptionally fortunate in finding
on board the <i>Dundrennon</i> part of an Indian
Mule Corps for service with the New Zealanders,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
commanded by Captain Alexander, and I cannot
be sufficiently grateful to him for the way
in which he set his men to work and helped us to
put away and tie up our equipment and mules.</p>

<p>I cannot say so much for the help given me by
the Captain of the <i>Dundrennon</i>, who was rather
a rough customer, and curtly informed me that
he had orders to sail at five o'clock <span class="smcap">A. M.</span> sharp,
and that, whether I was aboard or not, he meant
to weigh anchor at that hour.</p>

<p>All night long we worked feverishly, slinging
and unslinging with all possible haste, and while
I was using everybody up to breaking point in
my efforts to get through in time, Captain Edmunds,
who was in charge of the medical stores
for the Australians and New Zealanders, came
up to me and told me of the hopeless plight in
which he was placed. The Director of Medical
Services had ordered him to get himself, his men
and his stores as quickly as possible on board the
<i>Anglo-Egyptian</i>, but here again no means were
supplied to enable the order to be carried out.
"I can hardly dare appeal to you," he continued,
"to get me out of my difficulties, for I can see
that you will hardly get your own lot transferred
before five o'clock." I asked him if it was very
necessary that he should be put aboard, and he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
told me that, so far as he knew, his were the only
hospital stores available for the Australians and
New Zealanders.</p>

<p>This was a very grave matter, and although
I was very loth to give up all chance of completing
the transfer of my own Corps within the
time limit, yet I felt that this was a case which,
at all hazards to my own fortunes, must be seen
through, so that our gallant comrades from
Australia and New Zealand might not lack the
medical necessities which I knew would be required
the moment they got into action.</p>

<p>I, therefore, turned my men on to loading up
the hospital stores, and, when all was ready,
Murley towed us across to the <i>Anglo-Egyptian</i>,
where I eventually saw Captain Edmunds, his
staff of R. A. M. C. men and his stores safely
on board.</p>

<p>Some months afterwards Gye received a letter
from Captain Edmunds, written from
Anzac, in which he stated: "Remember me to
Colonel Patterson and tell him from me that
being able to get those stores on to the <i>Anglo-Egyptian</i>
averted what would have been an appalling
calamity from a medical point of view,
as I do not know what this place would have
done without my stores the first two days."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
So I think that Australia and New Zealand
owe me one for the help I gave them on that
strenuous night of April 24th, when I was buried
up to the neck in work of my own. It was
a great strain on my feelings of duty to risk
being left stuck on the mud, but I realised at the
time that I was doing not only what was right,
but what was essential from a military point of
view; and when I read that letter from Edmunds,
I felt very glad that I had risen to the
occasion and had put the needs of the Australians
and New Zealanders before my own.</p>

<p>By the time that the transfer was completed
it was 3.30 <span class="smcap">A. M.</span>, and I then knew that I could
not possibly get the remainder of my Zionists,
mules, equipment and stores transferred to the
<i>Dundrennon</i> by the time she was scheduled to
sail. I, therefore, went to the Captain and laid
my case before him, pointing out that it was impossible
to get everything transferred in time
and asking him would he delay sailing until we
were aboard. I have said that he was rather a
rough type of man. Having been for many
years master of a tramp steamer, he had spent
his life dealing with rough men and doing rough
work. I have, therefore, no doubt that he
thought he was answering me in quite a civil and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
polite way when he told me he would see me
damned before he delayed his ship five minutes.</p>

<p>I then asked my good friend the skipper of
the <i>Jessie</i> if he would run me down to the staff
ship, as I hoped to be able to get a written order
from somebody there, to the Captain of the <i>Dundrennon</i>,
cancelling the sailing at 5 <span class="smcap">A. M.</span> until
such time as I would have my unit complete on
board.</p>

<p>Off we sailed, threading our way in the dark
through such of the few warships and transport
vessels as had not yet sailed, and just before four
o'clock I found myself knocking at the cabin
door of a Naval Officer. After rapping for
some time, he called out "Come in," but the door
was locked, so he was obliged to get up to let me
in, and I am not surprised that his greeting to
me was not exactly one of brotherly love.
When I told him of my position and asked him
to give me an order delaying the departure of
the <i>Dundrennon</i>, he flatly refused to do it, and
said that the hours of departure of the ships were
fixed and that he was not the man to change the
order: I would have to go to the Captain of H.
M. S. <i>Hussar</i>, who was the man actually responsible
for the sailings. I pointed out to him
that by the time I reached the <i>Hussar</i>, which was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
still further off, and got at the Captain, and then
made my way back to the <i>Dundrennon</i>, it would
be long after five o'clock, and there would be no
<i>Dundrennon</i> there, for the ship would have
sailed! I urged that in a special case of this
kind I hoped he would over-rule the Time-table.
He was, however, most obdurate, and told me it
was useless for me to argue with him any longer.
When I pointed out to him that I had only received
means of transferring my Corps late the
previous evening, and that we had been working
all through the night, he snapped at me and said,
"Why do you make such a fuss about having
worked all through the night? That is nothing."
I quietly told him that I had once or
twice in my life worked all night without making
any fuss about it, and that I had merely wished
to impress upon him that it was not through any
fault or slackness on my part that the transfer
could not be completed in time. He was not
mollified, however, and practically marched me
off to the gangway, where he turned about and
made for his cabin. But I was not to be so
easily shaken off, so I promptly turned about
also and pursued him. I pointed out to him
emphatically that, unless he gave me this order,
on him would rest the entire responsibility of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
leaving the 29th Division in the lurch, as I
remarked that my Corps was the only one to
take them up food and water, and that if they
died of thirst he would be entirely to blame.
"What is the good of sending off the <i>Dundrennon</i>"
I asked, "unless she has on board the Corps
upon which so much depends? What will be
said hereafter if you let the 29th Division die of
thirst?"</p>

<p>This last appeal moved the naval man's
bowels of compassion; so without more ado he
had the office opened up, and wrote out an official
order delaying the sailing of the <i>Dundrennon</i>
until 8 o'clock. When I told him also that
the master of the <i>Dundrennon</i> was not very
helpful he at once wrote a curt note to him as
follows:</p>

<p>"I hear that you are not aiding Colonel Patterson
in his embarkation as much as you might.
You had better do so."</p>

<p>I kept this note for emergency, in case the
master of the <i>Dundrennon</i> might prove obstreperous,
but I had no occasion to use it.</p>

<p>I was delighted with my success, and so was
Murley, who was with me all the time I was endeavouring
to persuade the naval man to order
this very necessary delay. It was of course no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
light thing to take upon himself the responsibility
of altering the Time-table. I can only
say to him "Well done." We got back to the
<i>Dundrennon</i> at a quarter to five and were
greeted by the wrathful skipper, who was up and
preparing his ship for a punctual start. I
shouted up to him: "I have an order cancelling
your sailing until eight o'clock. Do you want
to see it?" "I do," was the gruff response.
"Pass it up on this rope," throwing a line aboard
the <i>Jessie</i>. I stuck the order between the
strands of the rope and the skipper hauled it up,
and as he read it he uttered highly flavoured
maledictions on all naval and army men, without
showing any undue partiality for either!</p>

<p>Now I was very glad that things had turned
out so happily, but even if I had not obtained the
order for the delay of the <i>Dundrennon</i>, I still
had a trump card up my sleeve, which I had
only intended to play in the last resort, namely,
to have seized the anchor winch and, at all costs,
have prevented any sailor from approaching it
until I gave orders that they might do so. I had
put fifty armed men on board ship, whom I was
prepared to use for this purpose in case of necessity,
as I was determined that I should go to
Gallipoli complete, even at the risk of seizing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
the ship and being, later on, tried for piracy on
the high seas!</p>

<p>This reminds me of an incident which happened
in the South African War when I had to
resort to almost similar methods. I was given
orders to entrain my squadron instantly at
Bloemfontein, but instead of being sent north
we were merely shunted into the Station siding,
where we had to remain for the best part of
twenty-four hours without any chance of watering
our horses. We started some time in the
night, and at daybreak the train was halted at a
siding where there was a stream running close
by. I looked at my horses and found many of
them down, owing to fatigue and want of water,
so I ordered the men to unbox them and take
them to water at the stream. When the guard
saw this he strongly objected, saying that the
train that was coming down might pass through
at any moment, and that, as soon as it had
passed, he would proceed on his way to Johannesburg,
whether the horses were back in the
boxes or not. I said: "Will you?" and he replied:
"Yes, I will. I am in charge of this
train and I am going to push on."</p>

<p>I thereupon called up the Sergeant-Major,
whispered an order to him, and in two seconds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
that guard found himself a prisoner on the platform
with a soldier on each side of him, with
orders to hold him fast in case he made any attempt
to get away. The watering was quietly
and expeditiously proceeded with, and meanwhile
the down train passed through.</p>

<p>Our engine driver came along the platform to
see what was the matter and I overheard the
guard telling him to proceed at once, even if he,
the guard, were left behind. I asked the driver
if he meant to carry out the guard's instructions
and he replied: "Yes." I then said: "Sergeant-Major,
two more men! make this driver a
prisoner."</p>

<p>When the watering of the horses was over I
released my prisoners and told them they could
now go on. The driver refused. I said: "All
right, then. I will drive myself." The look of
astonishment that came over the driver's face
when he saw me mount the footplate, confidently
put my hand on the lever and start the train, was
something to be remembered. He immediately
caved in, jumped up and resumed his duties,
without more ado. Some time afterwards I
heard that the guard made a bitter complaint
of my high-handedness, which eventually came
before General Tucker, then commanding at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
Bloemfontein, and it was a satisfaction to me
to learn that the General emphasised his approval
of what I had done in one of his choicest
expressions.</p>

<p>Even with the extension of the time limit, I
felt that it would be a close thing if we were to
get everything on board the <i>Dundrennon</i> by
eight o'clock, so we all worked with feverish
energy, and it was only by a great spurt on the
part of the <i>Jessie</i> that we finally got our last
three lighters, loaded to their utmost capacity,
made fast to the <i>Dundrennon</i> just before eight
o'clock. I knew that it would still take a good
hour to get everything aboard, so, drawing Murley
aside, I suggested to him that he must be in
need of a little refreshment after his strenuous
night, and that if he were to go to the skipper's
cabin he could, I felt sure, count on him to produce
a bottle&mdash;and I added: "Make sure that
he does not come out until I give you the signal."</p>

<p>Murley laughingly undertook this congenial
task, and when, after everything had been
stowed away, I eventually joined them at 9:10
<span class="smcap">A. M.</span>, I found the skipper thoroughly enjoying
himself and laughing heartily at one of Murley's
impromptu yarns. Bravo, Murley! If I am
ever ruler of the "King's Navee"&mdash;and stranger<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
things have happened&mdash;you may be sure that
you will be appointed an Admiral of the Fleet!</p>

<p>I don't know how to find you, but if these
lines ever come under your eye, remember that
dinner that you are to have with me in London,
and it shall be of the best, Murley, of the very
best.</p>

<p>I found, after all, that the old skipper's bark
was worse than his bite. He thawed towards
me to such an extent that, when I parted from
him at Gallipoli, he sped me on my way with a
present of two precious bottles of his best
whisky!&mdash;sign manual of his having taken me
to his rugged but withal kindly old heart.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>

<h3>DESCRIPTION OF SOUTHERN GALLIPOLI</h3>


<p>As I shall have to mention several places in
Gallipoli, it may be well before proceeding
further to give the reader some idea of the geography
of the place.</p>

<p>Gallipoli is a narrow, hilly peninsula, varying
from three to twelve miles wide, running south-westward
into the Ægean Sea, with the Dardanelles,
from one to four miles wide, separating it
from the Asiatic coast throughout its length of
some forty miles.</p>

<p>As I am going to speak more particularly of
the southern end of the Peninsula, I will only
describe that portion of it, as it was here that
the 29th Division landed, and the Zion Mule
Corps worked.</p>

<p>The dominating feature is the hill of Achi
Baba, some seven hundred feet high, which, with
its shoulders sloping down on the one side to the
Ægean and on the other to the Dardanelles,
shuts out all further view of the Peninsula to the
northward. There are only two villages in this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
area, Sedd-el-Bahr at the entrance to the Dardanelles,
and Krithia, with its quaint windmills, to
the southwest of Achi Baba, somewhat picturesquely
situated on the slope of a spur, some five
miles northwest of Sedd-el-Bahr&mdash;Achi Baba itself
being between six and seven miles from
Cape Helles, which is the most southerly point
of the Peninsula.</p>

<p>A line through Achi Baba from the Ægean
to the Dardanelles would be a little over five
miles, while the width at Helles is only about one
and a half miles.</p>

<p>A fairly good representation of this tract of
country will be obtained by holding the right-hand
palm upward and slightly hollowed, the
thumb pressed a little over the forefinger.
Imagine the Dardanelles running along by the
little finger up the arm, and the Ægean Sea on
the thumb side. Morto Bay, an inlet of the
Dardanelles, would then be at about the tip of a
short little finger; Sedd-el-Bahr Castle at the
tip of the third finger; V Beach between
the third finger and the middle finger; Cape
Helles the tip of the middle finger; W Beach between
the middle finger and the forefinger; X
Beach at the base of the nail of the forefinger;
Gully Beach between the tip of the thumb and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
the forefinger; Gully Ravine running up between
the thumb and forefinger towards Krithia
village, which is situated half-way up to the
thumb socket; Y Beach at the first joint of the
thumb; and Achi Baba in the centre of the heel
of the hand where it joins the wrist.</p>

<p>Anzac, where the Australians and New Zealanders
landed, would be some distance above the
wrist on the thumb side of the forearm; and
the Narrows of the Dardanelles would be on the
inner or little finger side of the forearm opposite
Anzac.</p>

<p>Imagine the sea itself lapping the lower part
of the hand on a level with the finger-nails, and
then the cliffs will be represented by the rise
from the finger-nails to the balls of the fingers.</p>

<p>The hollowed hand gives a very good idea of
the appearance of the country, which gradually
slopes down to a valley represented by the palm
of the hand. The lines on the hand represent
the many ravines and watercourses which intersect
the ground.</p>

<p>Practically the whole of this basin drains into
Morto Bay or the Dardanelles, with the exception
of Gully Ravine and the ravine running
down to Y Beach, which drain into the Ægean
Sea.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
A glance at the "handy" sketch will make
everything clear, but it does not pretend to strict
accuracy.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<h3>A HOMERIC CONFLICT</h3>


<p>Mudros Harbour was deserted as we sailed
through it on our way out, for all the warships
and transports had already left. Just beyond
the harbour entrance we passed the <i>Anglo-Egyptian</i>,
on the decks of which the other half
of the Zionists were crowded. We wondered
what had happened to detain her, for she was
lying at anchor; but we saw nothing amiss, and
lusty cheers were given and received as we
steamed past.</p>

<p>When we had rounded the land which guards
the entrance to the harbour, the <i>Dundrennon</i>
turned her bows northeastward and we steamed
off towards the land of our hopes and fears,
through a calm sea, which sparkled gaily in the
sunshine. The soft zephyr which followed us
from the south, changed suddenly and came
from the northeast, bringing with it the sound
of battle from afar. The dull boom of the guns
could now be plainly heard and told us that the
great adventure had already begun. How we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
all wished that the <i>Dundrennon</i> were a greyhound
of the seas and could rush us speedily to
the scene of such epoch-making events! But,
alas! she was only a slow old tramp, and going
"all out" she could do no more than twelve knots
an hour; and it seemed an eternity before we
actually came close enough to see anything of
the great drama which was being enacted.</p>

<p>As we ploughed along the calm sea, to the
slow beat of the engines, each hour seemed a century,
but at last we were able to distinguish the
misty outline of the Asiatic shore and, a little
later on, we saw, coming to meet us like an out-stretched
arm and hand, a land fringed and half-hidden
by the fire and smoke which enveloped it
as if some great magician had summoned the
powers of darkness to aid in its defence.</p>

<p>Soon battleships, cruisers and destroyers began
to outline themselves, and every few minutes
we could see them enveloped in a sheet of
flame and smoke, as they poured their broadsides
into the Turkish positions. The roar of the
<i>Queen Elizabeth's</i> heavy guns dwarfed all other
sounds, as this leviathan launched her huge projectiles&mdash;surely
mightier thunderbolts than Jove
ever hurled&mdash;against the foe. Every now and
again one of her shells would strike and burst on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
the very crest of Achi Baba, which then, as it
belched forth flame, smoke and great chunks of
the hill itself, vividly recalled to my mind Vesuvius
in a rage.</p>

<p>The whole scene was a sight for the gods, and
those of us mortals who witnessed it and survived
the day have forever stamped on our
minds the most wonderful spectacle that the
world has ever seen. Half the nations of the
earth were gathered there in a titanic struggle.
England, with her children from Australia and
New Zealand, and fellow subjects from India;
sons of France, with their fellow citizens from
Algeria and Senegal; Russian sailors and Russian
soldiers; Turks and Germans&mdash;all fighting
within our vision, some in Europe and some in
Asia.</p>

<p>Nor did the wonders end here, for, circling the
heavens like soaring eagles, were French and
British aeroplanes, while, under the sea, lurked
the deadly submarine.</p>

<p>It was altogether in the fitness of things that
this Homeric conflict should have its setting
within sight of the classic Plains of Troy.</p>

<p>Who will be the modern Homer to immortalise
the deeds done this day&mdash;deeds beside which
those performed by Achilles, Hector and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
other heroes of Greece and Troy pale into utter
insignificance? Certainly a far greater feat of
arms was enacted in Gallipoli on this 25th of
April, 1915, than was ever performed by those
ancient heroes on the Plains of Ilium, which lay
calm, green and smiling just across the sparkling
Hellespont.</p>

<p>Up the Dardanelles, as far as the Narrows,
we could see our ships of war, principally destroyers,
blazing away merrily and indiscriminately
at the guns, both on the European and
Asiatic shores. The sea was as calm as a mill-pond
round Cape Helles&mdash;the most southerly
point of the Peninsula; the only ripple to be seen
was that made by the strong current shot out
through the Straits. All round the men-of-war
Turkish shells were dropping, sending up veritable
waterspouts as they struck the sea, for,
luckily, very few of them hit the ships. It was
altogether the most imposing and awe-inspiring
sight that I have ever seen or am likely to see
again.</p>

<p>We were under orders to disembark, when
our turn came, at V Beach, a little cove to the
east of Cape Helles. As we approached near to
our landing-place, we could see through the haze,
smoke and dust, the gleam of bayonets, as men<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
swayed and moved hither and thither in the
course of the fight, while the roar of cannon and
the rattle of the machine-guns and rifles were
absolutely deafening. We could well imagine
what a veritable hell our brave fellows who were
attacking this formidable position must be facing,
for, in addition to rifle and machine-gun fire
from the surrounding cliffs, they were also at
times under a deadly cannonade from the Turkish
batteries established on the Asiatic shore.</p>

<p>The warships were slowly moving up and
down the coast blazing away fiercely at the
Turkish strongholds, battering such of them as
were left into unrecognisable ruins.</p>

<p>We in the transports lay off the shore in four
parallel lines, each successive line going forward
methodically and disembarking the units on
board as the ground was made good by the landing
parties.</p>

<p>We watched the fight from our position in the
line for the whole of that day, and never was excitement
so intense and long-sustained as during
those hours; nor was it lessened when night fell
upon us, for the roll of battle still continued&mdash;made
all the grander by the vivid flashes from
the guns which, every few moments, shot forth
great spurts of flame, brilliantly illuminating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
the inky darkness. Sedd-el-Bahr Castle and
the village nestling behind it were fiercely ablaze,
and cast a ruddy glare on the sky.</p>

<p>The next day, from a position much closer
inshore, we watched again the terrible struggle
of the landing-parties to obtain a grip on the
coast. We were one and all feverish with
anxiety to land and do something&mdash;no matter
how little&mdash;to help the gallant fellows who were
striving so heroically to drive the Turk from the
strong positions which he had carefully fortified
and strengthened in every possible way.</p>

<p>A most bloody battle was taking place, staged
in a perfect natural amphitheatre, but never had
Imperial Rome, even in the days of Nero himself,
gazed upon such a corpse-strewn, blood-drenched
arena.</p>

<p>This arena was formed partly by the sea,
which has here taken a semicircular bite out of
the rocky coast, and partly by a narrow strip of
beach which extended back for about a dozen
yards to a low rampart formed of sand, some
three or four feet high, which ran round the bay.
Behind this rampart the ground rose steeply upwards,
in tier after tier of grassy slopes, to a
height of about 100 feet, where it was crowned
by some ruined Turkish barracks. On the right,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
this natural theatre was flanked by the old castle
of Sedd-el-Bahr, whose battlements and towers
were even then crumbling down from the effects
of the recent bombardment by the Fleet. To
the left of the arena, high cliffs rose sheer from
the sea, crowned by a modern redoubt. Barbed
wire zig-zagged and criss-crossed through arena
and amphitheatre&mdash;and such barbed wire! It
was twice as thick, strong and formidable as any
I had ever seen.</p>

<p>The cliffs and galleries were trenched and full
of riflemen, as were also the barracks, the ruined
fort, and Sedd-el-Behr Castle. Machine-guns
and pom-poms were everywhere, all ready to
pour a withering fire on any one approaching or
attempting to land on the beach.</p>

<p>It is small wonder, therefore, that so few
escaped from that terrible arena of death. Indeed,
the wonder is that any one survived that
awful ordeal.</p>

<p>The little cove was peaceable enough on the
morning of the 25th, when the Transport <i>River
Clyde</i> steamed in. It was part of the scheme to
run her ashore at this beach and, as it was known
that the venture would be a desperate one, what
was more fitting than that she should be filled
with Irish soldiers (the Dublins and Munsters)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>&mdash;regiments
with great fighting records? With
them was also half a battalion of the Hampshire
Regiment. Special preparations had been made
to disembark the troops as quickly as possible.
Great holes had been cut in the iron sides of the
<i>River Clyde</i>, and from these gangways made of
planking, which were of course lashed to the
ship, sloped down in tiers to the water's edge.
From the ends of these gangways a string of
lighters stretched to the shore to enable the men
to rush quickly to land.</p>

<p>In addition to those on the <i>River Clyde</i>, three
companies of the Dublin Fusiliers were towed
to the beach in open boats and barges by little
steam pinnaces. It had been intended that
these should steal in during the dark hours just
before dawn, but, owing to miscalculations of
the speed of the current, or some other cause,
the boats did not arrive in time and only reached
the shore at the same moment that Commander
Unwin, R. N., of the <i>River Clyde</i>, according to
the prearranged plan, coolly ran his vessel
aground. This man&oelig;uvre must have greatly astonished
the Turks, but not a sound or move did
they make, and it seemed at first as if the landing
would not be opposed. As soon, however,
as the Munsters began to pour from her sides,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
a perfect hail of lead opened on the unfortunate
soldiers, who were shot down in scores as they
raced down the gangway. Some who were
struck in the leg stumbled and fell into the water,
where, owing to the weight of their packs and
ammunition, they went to the bottom and were
drowned. For days afterwards these unfortunate
men could be seen through the clear
water, many of them still grasping their rifles.</p>

<p>The men in the boats suffered equally heavily
and had even less chance of escape. Many were
mown down by rifle fire and sometimes a shell
cut a boat in two and the unfortunate soldiers
went to the bottom, carried down by the weight
of their equipment.</p>

<p>The sailors who were detailed to assist in the
landing performed some heroic deeds. Theirs
was the task of fixing the lighters from the gangways
of the <i>River Clyde</i> to the shore. Even in
ordinary times it would be a very difficult task,
owing to the strong current which sweeps round
from the Dardanelles, but to do it practically at
the muzzle of the enemy's rifles demanded men
with the hearts of lions. Scores were shot down
as they tugged and hauled to get the lighters
into position. Scores more were ready to jump
into their places. More than once the lighters<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
broke loose and the whole perilous work had to
be done over again, but our gallant seamen
never failed. They just "carried on."</p>

<p>Commander (now Captain) Unwin was
awarded the Victoria Cross for fearlessly risking
his life on more than one occasion in endeavouring
to keep the lighters in position under the
pitiless hail of lead.</p>

<p>Those naval men whose duty it was to bring
the Dublins ashore in small boats were shot down
to a man, for there was no escape for them from
that terrible fire. Both boats and crew were destroyed,
either on the beach, or before they
reached it.</p>

<p>In spite of the rain of death some of the Dublins
and Munsters succeeded in effecting a landing
and making a dash for shelter from the tornado
of fire under the little ridge of sand which,
as I have already mentioned, ran round the
beach. Had the Turks taken the precaution of
levelling this bank of sand, not a soul could have
lived in that fire-swept zone. More than half
of the landing-party were killed before they
could reach its friendly shelter and many others
were left writhing in agony on that narrow strip
of beach. Brigadier-General Napier and his
Brigade Major, Captain Costeker, were killed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
as was also Lieut.-Colonel Carrington Smith,
commanding the Hampshires; the Adjutants of
the Hampshires and of the Munsters were
wounded and, indeed, the great majority of the
senior officers were either wounded or killed.</p>

<p>Many anxious eyes were peering out over the
protected bulwarks of the <i>River Clyde</i>, and
among them was Father Finn, the Roman Catholic
Chaplain of the Dublins. The sight of
some five hundred of his brave boys lying dead
or dying on that terrible strip of beach was too
much for him, so, heedless of all risk, he plunged
down the gangway and made for the shore. On
the way, his wrist was shattered by a bullet, but
he went on, and although lead was spattering all
round him like hailstones, he administered consolation
to the wounded and dying, who, alas!
were so thickly strewn around. For a time he
seemed to have had some miraculous form of
Divine protection, for he went from one to another
through shot and shell without receiving
any further injury. At last a bullet struck him
near the hip, and, on seeing this, some of the
Dublins rushed out from the protection of the
sandbank and brought him into its shelter.
When, however, he had somewhat recovered
from his wound, nothing would induce him to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
remain in safety while his poor boys were being
done to death in the open, so out he crawled
again to administer comfort to a poor fellow
who was moaning piteously a little way off; and
as he was in the act of giving consolation to the
stricken man, this heroic Chaplain was struck
dead by a merciful bullet.</p>

<p>Father Finn has, so far, been granted no V.C.,
but if there is such a thing in heaven, I am
sure he is wearing it, and His Holiness Benedict
XV might do worse than canonise this heroic
priest, for surely no saint ever died more nobly:
"Greater love hath no man than this, that a man
lay down his life for his friends."</p>

<p>The Turkish position was so strong and they
were able to pour down such a concentrated fire
from pit, box, dress-circle, and gallery of their
natural theatre, that every man of these gallant
Irish regiments who showed himself in the open
was instantly struck down. So hot and accurate
was this close range Turkish fire that the disembarkation
from the <i>River Clyde</i> had to be discontinued.</p>

<p>The little body of men who had escaped death
and ensconced themselves under the sandbank
kept up a lively fire on the Turks as long as their
ammunition lasted, but there they had to remain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
for the best part of thirty-six hours, more or
less at the mercy of the enemy. An attempt
to dislodge them was, however, easily repelled by
fire from the warships, as well as from the
machine-guns on the decks of the <i>River Clyde</i>.</p>

<p>It was not until after nightfall that the remainder
of the Irishmen could disembark, and
then all the units had to be reorganised to enable
them to make an attack on the formidable Turkish
trenches on the following morning.</p>

<p>Practically every officer of the Dublins and
Munsters was either killed or wounded, very few
escaped scot free. The Dublins were particularly
unfortunate, for at another landing-place,
Camber Beach, close by Sedd-el-Bahr village,
out of 125 men landed, only 25 were left at midday.
Nevertheless, the fragments of the two
battalions were pulled together by Lieut.-Colonel
Doughty-Wylie and Lieut.-Colonel Williams,
assisted by Captain Walford, R. A., Brigade
Major. It will be readily understood what
an arduous task it was to reorganise men who for
over twenty-four hours had been subjected to
the most murderous and incessant fire that ever
troops had had to face; but nothing is impossible
when really determined men make up their
minds that it must be done, and early morning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
of the 26th April found the Dublins and Munsters
and some of the Hampshires, led by
Doughty-Wylie and Walford, dashing at the
Turkish trenches, which they carried at the point
of the bayonet. They rushed position after position,
and by noon Sedd-el-Bahr village was in
our hands, and here the gallant Walford was
killed. Sedd-el-Bahr Castle yet remained to be
taken, and it was while leading the final attack
on the keep of this stronghold that the heroic
Colonel Doughty-Wylie fell, mortally wounded,
at the moment of victory. The posthumous
honour of the Victoria Cross was granted to these
two officers to commemorate their glorious deeds.</p>

<p>At the other landing-places the fighting had
also been very fierce. At W Beach the Lancashire
Fusiliers had a terribly difficult task in
storming an almost impregnable position, which
had been carefully prepared beforehand by the
Turks. The high ground overlooking the beach
had been strongly fortified with trenches; land
mines and sea mines had been laid; wire entanglements
extended round the shore and a
barbed network had also been placed in the shallow
water. Like V Beach it was a veritable
death trap, but the brave Lancashires, after suffering
terrible losses, succeeded in making good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
the landing and drove the Turks out of their
trenches. In commemoration of their gallantry
this Beach was afterwards known as Lancashire
Landing.</p>

<p>The 2nd Battalion South Wales Borderers
under Colonel Casson were able to land at S
Beach, Morto Bay, and seize the high ground
near De Tott's Battery, to which they tenaciously
held on until the main body had driven
the Turks back, when they joined hands with
the troops from V Beach and continued the advance.</p>

<p>X Beach was stormed by the 1st Battalion
Royal Fusiliers and part of the Anson Battalion
Royal Naval Division, who drove before them
such Turks as they found on the cliffs. They
were reinforced by two more Battalions of the
87th Brigade, and after some heavy slogging
they eventually got into touch with the Lancashire
Fusiliers and Worcesters and so eased the
pressure on V Beach by threatening the Turkish
flank.</p>

<p>The landing on Y Beach was effected by the
King's Own Scottish Borderers and the Plymouth
Battalion of the Royal Marines. These
splendid fellows forced their way into Krithia
village, but want of ammunition and reinforcements<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
obliged them to fall back to the beach,
where they were almost overwhelmed by the
enemy and lost more than half their numbers;
eventually they were compelled to re-embark, but
not before they had done immense damage to the
Turks and considerably helped the troops who
were forcing the other landings.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the two Australian-New Zealand
Divisions were engaged in the perilous enterprise
of forcing a landing in the face of a large
Turkish force at a place now known as Anzac
(this word being formed from the initial letters
of Australian-New Zealand Army Corps). In
the dark hour before the dawn some four thousand
of these splendid fighters were towed in
silence towards the shore, and here again it
seemed as if they would meet with no opposition;
but not so&mdash;the Turk was not to be caught napping,
and, while the boats were still some way
from land, thousands of Turkish soldiers rushed
along the strip of beach to intercept the boats,
and the heavy fire which they opened caused
very severe casualties in the ranks; nothing, however,
could daunt Colonel Maclagan and the men
of the 3rd Australian Brigade; the moment the
boats touched the shore these dare-devils leaped
into the water and with irresistible fury drove<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
the Turks before them at the point of the bayonet.
Nothing could stand up against their onslaught,
and by noon, having been reinforced,
they had "hacked" their way some miles inland,
put several Krupp guns out of action, and if
they had been supported by even one more Division,
the road to the Narrows would undoubtedly
have been won. As it was, owing to lack
of sufficient men to hold what they had made
good, they were compelled to retire to the ridges
overlooking the sea, and there for eight months
they held the Turks at bay and hurled back, with
frightful losses, every assault made on their
position. Oh, if only the 29th Division had also
been landed here, what a sweeping victory we
would have won!</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>

<h3>THE ZION MULE CORPS LANDS IN GALLIPOLI</h3>


<p>The beach, cliffs and Castle were now in our
hands, and disembarkation for the remainder of
the army was possible. While the great battle
for the landing was going on, we had been fretting
and fuming at being left so long idle spectators.
Thinking that it was high time we
should disembark, and finding that no orders
came along for us, I felt that in order to get a
move on I must make a personal effort. I therefore
hailed a trawler which happened to be passing,
and got it to take me over to the <i>Cornwallis</i>,
on which I knew General Hunter-Weston, the
Commander of the 29th Division, had his temporary
headquarters.</p>

<p>The General was glad to see me, and said I
had turned up just in the very nick of time, for
my Zion men were urgently required ashore to
take ammunition, food and water to the men
in the firing line. He appealed to Admiral
Wemyss, who was close by, to detail trawlers
and lighters to get my Corps ashore as quickly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
as possible. The Admiral very kindly told off
a naval officer to come with me, and he in his
turn found a trawler and some horse boats which
were soon alongside the <i>Dundrennon</i>.</p>

<p>From two to six o'clock <span class="smcap">P. M.</span> we were busily
employed loading up and sending mules and
equipment ashore. I noticed that the officer in
charge of our trawler was a bit of a bungler at
his job; time after time he would fail in his judgment;
when getting the barges alongside he had
repeatedly to sail round and round the <i>Dundrennon</i>
with his tow before he got near enough for
a rope to be cast; he was not a regular naval
man&mdash;just a "dug-out." How I longed then
for my friend Murley!</p>

<p>I must say here that in my humble opinion
the Navy failed us badly in the matter of tugs,
lighters and horse boats; there were not nearly
enough of these, and we could have done with
three times the number. My Corps, which was
most urgently wanted by the General, took
three days to disembark, in spite of our most
strenuous efforts to get ashore as quickly as possible.
The delay was entirely due to the lack
of tugs, for it was only now and then that a
trawler could be spared to haul us inshore. We
were sadly held up and kept waiting for hours<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
after our boats had been loaded up, ready to be
towed ashore.</p>

<p>Who was responsible for this shortage I do
not know. It is, of course, quite possible that
the Navy provided all the trawlers requisitioned
for by the Army.</p>

<p>I had taken the precaution while on the ship
to fill all my tins with fresh drinking water, and
these had to be unloaded by hand from the
lighters. To do this I arranged my men in a
long line, stretching the whole length of the
temporary pier from the lighters to the beach,
and in this manner the cans of water were rapidly
passed ashore from hand to hand.</p>

<p>While we were engaged on this work the guns
from Asia were making very good shooting,
shells striking the water within a few yards of
us, just going over our heads, a little to the right
or a little to the left, but always just missing.
I watched my men very carefully to see how they
would stand their baptism of fire, and I am
happy to be able to say that, with one solitary
exception, all appeared quite unconcerned and
took not the slightest heed of the dangerous
position they were in. The one exception was a
youth from the <i>Yemen</i>, who trembled and chattered
with nervousness; but when I went up to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
him, shook him somewhat ungently, and asked
him what was the matter, he bent to his work
and the cans passed merrily along. In fact,
everybody there, especially the naval men who
helped us to catch our mules as they jumped
from the horse boats into the sea, treated the
cannonade from Asia as a joke, and every time
a shell missed a hearty laugh went up at the bad
shooting of the Turkish gunners. It was only a
mere fluke, however, that the shells did not hit
the target aimed at, because, as a matter of fact,
the shooting was particularly good and only
missed doing a considerable amount of damage
by a few yards each time. We were exceedingly
fortunate in not losing a single man during the
whole period of disembarkation.</p>

<p>Practically the first officer I met as I stepped
ashore was Colonel Moorehouse, whom I had not
seen for years, and he was most helpful in the
present emergency. I found that he was in
charge of the landing operations on the beach,
and I believe he had given up a Governorship,
or some such billet, in West Africa to do his bit
in the Dardanelles.</p>

<p>While we were disembarking, General
d'Amade, who was commanding the French
Corps Expéditionnaire, stepped ashore and soon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
afterwards the French troops began to pour on
to the beach.</p>

<p>During the great battle which took place on
the 25th and 26th for the possession of V Beach,
the French battleships and gunboats, together
with the Russian cruiser <i>Askold</i>, had been battering
down the fortress of Kum Kale on the
Asiatic side of the Dardanelles, some two and a
half miles in a direct line from Sedd-el-Bahr.</p>

<p>In the face of much opposition the French
troops forced a landing, and after some heavy
fighting defeated the Turks and captured many
hundreds of prisoners. There is no doubt that
this diversion averted much of the shell fire
which would otherwise have been concentrated
on those of us landing at V Beach. Having
driven the Turks out and effectively destroyed
Kum Kale, the French troops were re-embarked
hurriedly, brought across the Dardanelles,
landed at V Beach in feverish haste, and flung
into the thick of the fight which was still raging
just north of the village of Sedd-el-Bahr.</p>

<p>I watched them disembark, and it was magnificent
to see the verve and dash which the
French gunners displayed in getting their beloved
.75s into action.</p>

<p>Our naval men helped to bring the guns<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
ashore, but the moment the Frenchmen got them
there they had them away and in action on the
ridge to the north of the amphitheatre in an incredibly
short space of time.</p>

<p>As soon as we had got a couple of hundred
mules ashore, I was ordered to march them off
to W Beach, which was on the western side of
Cape Helles. Having had some experience of
the ways of soldiers on active service, I knew that
we should have to keep a very sharp eye on our
gear as it came ashore, otherwise it would be
appropriated by the first comer. I therefore
left Lieutenant Claude Rolo on the beach to look
after the mules, horses and stores as they were
disembarked, and incidentally to dodge the shells
which more than once covered him with sand but
did no further damage. I had left Lieutenant
Gye on board the <i>Dundrennon</i> to see to the work
of loading up the barges.</p>

<p>On the way to W Beach we were fired on by
Turkish riflemen who had not as yet been driven
very far away from the shore, but fortunately
we sustained no damage.</p>

<p>The Lancashire Fusiliers, as I have already described,
had a terribly difficult task in forcing
their way on to W Beach, and the moment I
saw it I could well realise what an arduous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
undertaking it must have been. It looked, like
V Beach, an impossibility, but the Lancashire
lads could not be denied, and all honour to them
for having stormed such a fearsome stronghold.
By the time I got there there was already
a huge stock of ammunition and supplies piled
up on the shore, and these we at once began to
load up on the mules to take out to the men in
the firing line, who were constantly driving the
Turks before them further and further from the
beach.</p>

<p>I shall never forget my first night in Gallipoli.
We loaded up a couple of hundred mules,
each mule carrying about two thousand cartridges,
and with Major O'Hara (now Lieut.-Colonel
O'Hara), who was the D.&nbsp;A.&nbsp;Q.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;G.,
as guide, we marched off into the darkness to distribute
ammunition along the front.</p>

<p>Major O'Hara came with me, partly because
he knew the way, and partly because he wanted
to make sure what were the most urgent needs
of the men in the trenches. We trudged together
all through that trying night, so it is not
much to be wondered at that we almost quarrelled
once or twice&mdash;but I will say here that of
all the men I met in Gallipoli there was not one
who was so capable at his job, or worked so hard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
to see that everything for which he was responsible
ran smoothly. Oh, if only our Army could
be staffed with O'Haras, what a wonderfully efficient
machine our Army would be!</p>

<p>Soon after we left W Beach in the dark it
began to pour, and it poured and poured solidly
for about five hours.</p>

<p>On we squelched through the mud over unknown
tracks with the water streaming down
our bodies and running in rivulets out of our
boots. As soon as the rain ceased a biting cold
wind set in, which froze us to the marrow.
However, the vigorous walking, helping up a
fallen mule, readjusting the loads, getting out
of holes into which we had tumbled, etc., kept
our circulation going, and when we arrived at a
place known as Pink Farm, the furthest point
to which we had yet advanced, there was a sudden
alarm that the Turks were approaching.
Nobody knew then where our front line was, or
whether it linked up across the Peninsula.
There were many gaps in it through which the
Turks, if they had had initiative enough, might
have forced their way and inflicted a considerable
amount of damage upon us before we could
have organised adequate resistance.</p>

<p>On the first alarm of the approaching Turks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
I sent a man out to reconnoitre, formed my little
escort in open order, prone on the grass, and
asked Major Moore, D. S. O. of the General
Staff, now Brigadier-General Moore, to bring
some men from the trenches, if he could find
them, as quickly as possible, for I had no desire
to lose my convoy at such an early stage of the
proceedings.</p>

<p>Gongs could plainly be heard sounding, apparently
close by, as though it was some prearranged
signal of the enemy, but whatever the
reason we saw nothing of the Turks, and no attack
was made, so we unloaded our ammunition
and were then sent back for more by Colonel B.
to Lancashire Landing. Now Colonel B. of the
Headquarters Staff told me personally on no
account to bring back supplies, but only ammunition,
as no supplies were needed at this place
for the present. Unluckily O'Hara was not on
the spot when Colonel B. gave me these explicit
and reiterated instructions, so when we got back
to the beach he wished to load up supplies, but
this I refused to do owing to the specific orders
I had received. O'Hara was furious but I was
obdurate, so, of course, we loaded up with ammunition.</p>

<p>Back again we trudged steadily through rain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
and slush towards the Pink Farm. When we
had got about half-way, we were met by a Staff
Officer who told us,&mdash;to O'Hara's great satisfaction,&mdash;that
it was not ammunition which was
now wanted at the Pink Farm but supplies. I
am not at all sure that I did not overhear O'Hara
call me "an obstinate damn fool," but it is as
well to be hard of hearing as it is to possess a
blind eye on occasions.</p>

<p>The upshot was that we had to return to the
beach, unload the ammunition, load up boxes of
tinned beef, cheese, biscuits and jam, and then
back again along the "sludgy squdgy" road we
trudged once more towards that never-to-be-forgotten
Pink Farm. Again we got about half-way
there, when yet another Staff Officer met
us, who told us that the supplies were not wanted
by the brigade holding the line at the Pink
Farm, but by the brigade holding the line on
the extreme right, where they were urgently required,
and he ordered us to take them there
without delay. It was now my turn to chuckle,
and I observed to O'Hara that there "really
must be a damn fool somewhere about after all."</p>

<p>Without a murmur we turned back once more,
for, not knowing the country, nor where we
might bump into the enemy, we could not take<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
a short cut across, so were forced to return to W
Beach. From thence we went along the track
by the Helles cliff which took us to the top of V
Beach; our route then led us through Sedd-el-Bahr
village, where we were warned by a French
soldier that we would be sniped by Turks as
there were many still lurking there.</p>

<p>When we got safely clear of this jumpy place,
we found ourselves wending our way through
some Turkish cemeteries, the tall, white, thin
headstones, with their carved headlike top knobs,
looking exactly like ghosts in the gloomy light.
We passed through cypress groves, along sandy
lanes, and rugged paths, fell into and scrambled
out of dug-outs, ditches and dongas, where
mules and loads tumbled about indiscriminately
to the accompaniment of much profanity.</p>

<p>At one spot on this adventurous journey we
came upon a Battalion of Zouaves crouching
down for rest and shelter in the lee of a hedge.
The sergeant in charge of my escort took them
for Turks, and only that I was happily on the
spot when he made this startling discovery, he
would undoubtedly have opened fire on the
Frenchmen. I must say that they looked exactly
like Turks, owing to their semi-barbaric
uniform.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
When we got the convoy to where we thought
the front line ought to be, we failed to find it,
and as we were very hazy as to whether we would
run into our own men or the Turks, we left the
convoy under the cover of some trees, and
O'Hara and I went off to reconnoitre. I believe
we must have passed through a gap in our
own line. At all events we wandered for some
time, making many pauses to listen for any
sound that might guide us, but the weird thing
about it was, that the whole place was now still
as death, though we must have been quite close
to both armies. No doubt they were dead beat
after the recent terrific fighting they had come
through.</p>

<p>At last we luckily struck our own men, lining
a shallow trench which had apparently been
very hastily thrown up, for it scarcely afforded
enough cover to shelter a decent-sized terrier.
The men were so exhausted with the continued
strain and stress of the battle, which had been
continuous since the morning of the 25th, that
they slept as if they were dead. The sentries,
of course, were on the alert, looking out grim
and watchful at the Turkish line, which we could
just make out in the struggling moonlight, apparently
not more than two hundred yards away.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
Telling the sentinel in a low voice, so as not
to draw the Turkish fire, that we had brought up
a convoy of supplies, and that we were about to
unload them among some trees a couple of hundred
yards further back, we ordered him to pass
this information on to the Brigade Headquarters,
so that arrangements might be made for the
distribution of the food before daybreak.</p>

<p>We then turned back, and taking the mules
out of the shelter of the trees where we had left
them, we brought the supplies as close as possible
to the firing line, where we stacked them
under cover.</p>

<p>Here again O'Hara's thoroughness and readiness
to help in all things came out, for he was
one of the busiest men in the convoy, helping to
unload, putting the boxes in order, and removing
our pack-ropes from the cases, for, of course,
these always had to be untied and taken back
with the mules.</p>

<p>We saw some pathetic sights on our way back
to W Beach; we were obliged to stop every now
and again so as not to bump into the wounded
men who were being carried down on stretchers
to the ships all night long by the devoted R. A.
M. C. orderlies.</p>

<p>When we topped the crest overlooking W<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
Beach, a gleam of light was coming up out of
Asia, telling us of the approach of dawn, and
we felt, as we wearily strode down the slope to
the beach, that we had done a hard and useful
night's work.</p>

<p>Now, when I had disembarked from the <i>Dundrennon</i>
soon after midday, I had no idea that I
would be hustled off to the trenches at an instant's
notice. I had expected to go back to the
ship again for at least one more load of mules,
and I had therefore nothing with me except
what I stood up in&mdash;no food or equipment of
any kind, and beyond a dry biscuit and some
cheese, I had had nothing to eat since lunch-time,
so that it can be well imagined I was fairly
ravenous when I had finished that night's trek.
There was no food to be had just yet, however,
and in any case I had to see to the watering and
feeding of my mules, for they, like myself, had
been without food or drink since the previous
midday.</p>

<p>This job was finished by about 7 <span class="smcap">A. M.</span> and
soon after that I joined O'Hara at an excellent
breakfast, after which I felt ready for another
strenuous day.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>

<h3>A NIGHT UP THE GULLY RAVINE</h3>


<p>Feeling greatly refreshed after my breakfast
with O'Hara, I went to select a suitable place
for our camp, or rather bivouac, for, of course,
we had no tents. Finding a snug little valley
which stood back a couple of hundred yards
from W Beach and which ran up under the protection
of a rise in the ground, which gave us
some slight cover from the Turks, I put all
hands on to prepare and level the ground for the
horse and mule lines.</p>

<p>We had been rushed to the trenches in such
haste with the ammunition and supplies that we
had been unable to bring any rope with which to
tether the mules, so, seeing some ship's rope lying
on the beach, I asked the naval officer in charge
to let me have it for my lines. He not only did
this, but lent me some of his men as well to carry
it up to my little camp, where they helped me to
fix it in the ground. I am sorry to say I forget
this officer's name, as he was most helpful to me
in many ways, and I never had to appeal in vain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
to him, or, as a matter of fact, to any other naval
officer for assistance.</p>

<p>Throughout the day there was more than
enough to do. The ground had to be levelled
off, so as to make comfortable the mule and horse
lines. Ropes had to be pegged down and the
ends of them buried in the ground, tied round
sacks filled with clay, drains trenched out, and
the larger stones thrown out of the way. Then
the mules had to be fed and watered, and I
feared the latter was going to be a difficult and
dangerous business, for the only water discovered
so far came under Turkish fire. Luckily
for me, however, one of my men, Schoub, my
farrier sergeant, discovered a deep well carefully
hidden at the corner of a demolished building,
standing at the head of the little valley
where we were camped. I feared that it might
have been poisoned, so to solve my doubts I
went to the Provost Marshal, and borrowed from
him one of the captured Turkish prisoners. I
felt sure that a Turk coming from these parts
would know the natural taste of the water, so I
took him with me to the well and asked him to
drink. He was rather loth to do this at first,
but at last, with a little persuasion, he took a
sip in his mouth, rolled it for a moment on his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
tongue, then, nodding approval, drank freely of
the water. As he survived the ordeal, I thought
it was all right to go ahead with the mules, and
later on we used the well ourselves, for it was
excellent water.</p>

<p>All day long parties were coming and going
between V and W Beaches; forage, water tins,
supplies, etc.&mdash;everything had to be brought to
us on our pack mules, and the day was all too
short to do the many things that landing in a
new country in time of warfare makes necessary.
Not much time was wasted over the
cooking of food; biscuits, jam, cheese, tinned
beef, required no fires; only a little tea was
boiled in our hastily-made camp kitchens. The
only fuel to be had was obtained by breaking up
some of our old packing-cases; the Turks had
cleared off everything&mdash;not a man, woman,
child or beast was left on the place&mdash;but this
did not worry us, as we were always able to rustle
for ourselves.</p>

<p>Before dark that night we began to load up
another big convoy of munitions and supplies
for the trenches.</p>

<p>This proved to be one of the most weird nights
of many that we have spent tramping up and
down the peninsula.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
Of course, we had to move off after dark,
otherwise the Turks would have concentrated
their artillery on us and we should all have been
destroyed. We went from W to X Beach,
along the Ægean shore, falling into trenches
and dug-outs on the way, for the night was very
dark, while every now and again we were caught
up in Turkish wire entanglements. Then from
X Beach we slowly pioneered our way through
the trackless scrub and undergrowth until we
came to the cliff which overlooks Gully Beach,
at the mouth of a huge ravine which here opened
into the Ægean Sea, some miles northwest of W
Beach.</p>

<p>On the way we had to go through some of our
own guns, which were in action on this side of
the Peninsula, and I had to request the Battery
Commander to cease fire while we were filing
past, as I feared the roar and flash of the guns
might stampede the mules. He let us through
in silence, but we had scarcely got fifty yards
from the muzzles when out belched the guns
again, the roar of which at such close range, to
my surprise, did not in the least upset the mules.
I shall never forget our struggling down to the
sea from the cliffs above the Gully. Of course
there was no road then and we had to reconnoitre<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
ahead in the dark every yard of the way.
Often I had to turn back and call out to the men
to halt as I found myself dangling on the edge
of the cliff, holding on to the roots of the gorse,
which fortunately grew there in profusion.
After many mishaps, mules and supplies falling
about among the ravines which scored the
face of the cliff, we eventually reached the
beach.</p>

<p>Then began our march up the bed of the
ravine, and although the Gully was very wide
and there was ample room to march either to
right or left of the stream, yet we knew nothing
of this, for the ground was new to us and everything
was pitch dark, so the only sure way of
getting up the ravine in safety was to walk in
the river bed. I led the way, expecting all the
time either to fall into a waterhole or be shot by
an ambuscade of Turks. Cliffs loomed up on
either side of us to a height of a hundred or more
feet, and there was nothing to be seen but the
faint twinkle of the stars overhead.</p>

<p>Now and again I called a halt to reconnoitre
and listen for any suspicious movements ahead,
as it was a most likely spot in which to be ambushed
by the enemy. So far as I knew the
Turks were in possession of the bank to my left,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
and all that part of the country right up to
Anzac, where the Australians had landed. For
a time everything was quiet as we splashed our
way along, there being a lull just then in the
fighting; all of a sudden it broke out again with
feverish intensity. The Gully Ravine made a
turn at one part of its course which took us right
between the line of fire of the two opposing
forces. Shells from our own guns screamed and
passed safely over the ravine, but the shells from
the Turkish batteries often burst exactly overhead,
scattering shrapnel all round, at other
times plunking into the cliff on our right and
smothering us with clay and gravel. The rattle
of musketry was like the continuous roll of
kettledrums, and considering all our surroundings,
and the fierce fight that was going on, it
was altogether a night to be remembered.</p>

<p>At last we reached the troops holding the
front line; there were no supports or reserves, so
far as I could see; every man had been put into
the firing line, owing to the terrible losses that
had been sustained.</p>

<p>Here in the dark, with shot and shell flying all
round, we unpacked our mules and handed over
the ammunition and food to the brigade.</p>

<p>I was right glad to be able to turn back and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
get my convoy safely away from the gloomy
depths of this uncanny ravine.</p>

<p>We had again to climb the cliffs when we got
back to the sea at the gully-mouth, and at the
top again to negotiate our guns, which were still
blazing away for all they were worth. However,
by dint of much shouting when I had crawled
close enough to be heard, the gunners ceased fire
just long enough to enable us to slip through.</p>

<p>These two nights are fair examples of the work
done in those early days by the Zion Mule Corps,
at that time the only transport corps on the Peninsula
at Helles.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>

<h3>HOW ZION MULES UPSET TURKISH PLANS</h3>


<p>It will be remembered that I left Claude Rolo
on V Beach to take charge of our gear as it came
off the <i>Dundrennon</i>, while Gye was left aboard
that vessel to hurry everything ashore; but it was
not until the third day that we had disembarked
all our belongings, the delay being entirely due
to the shortage of steam tugs, on which I have
already commented.</p>

<p>During the time that our gear was stacked on
V Beach, with, of course, a guard in charge of it,
one of the sentries became the object of suspicion
to the French, who were now in entire control
of V Beach. After a few minutes, finding he
could speak no understandable language (for he
only spoke Russian or Hebrew, which, no doubt,
sounded Turkish to the French), and seeing that
he was armed with a Turkish rifle and bayonet
and had Turkish cartridges in his belt, he was
taken for a daring Turk who had invaded the
beach to spy out the land. Without more ado,
he was tried by drum-head court-martial and condemned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
to be shot out of hand. He was actually
up against the walls of Sedd-el-Bahr Castle,
and the firing party in position to carry out the
execution, when the Sergeant in charge of the
Zionist Guard luckily spied what was happening,
and, as he spoke excellent French, he rapidly
explained the situation. The man was released,
but the shock was too much for him, and when
he was unbound he was found to be paralysed,
and it was two months before he was fit for duty
again. After this, I allowed none of my men
to leave camp unless they could speak English
or were accompanied by some one who could act
as interpreter.</p>

<p>Gye and Rolo worked hard to move the pile
of equipment&mdash;water tins, forage, etc., etc., to the
little valley where the rest of the Corps were already
snugly encamped, overlooking W Beach.
I was extremely glad to have these two officers
with me again, because, during these three days
and nights since the landing, while we were
separated, I had had a very strenuous time.</p>

<p>I remember when Gye saw me for the first
time after coming ashore, he got quite a shock,
and I believe he must have imagined that I had
been indulging in some frightful orgy, because
he observed that the whites of my eyes were as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
red as burning coals; but it was only an orgy
of work and want of sleep.</p>

<p>I may say that when I did sleep I slept very
soundly indeed, for a high explosive shell dropped
within seven or eight feet of my head, exploded,
blew a great hole in the ground, yet I never even
heard it!</p>

<p>This feat was outdone by a man who, on being
roused in the morning, found himself lame,
and then discovered that he had been shot through
the foot some time in the night, while asleep!</p>

<p>The work, owing to Gye and Rolo being with
me, was now considerably lightened, as we each
took a convoy out to different parts of the front,
and so got the distribution of supplies through
much more quickly. I was unable at that time
to make use of my Jewish officers, with the exception
of Captain Trumpledor, for they were
without experience and could not speak English.
Later on they were able to take charge of convoys
and did the work very well.</p>

<p>Gye, Rolo and I made a cheery little party
and never found the time hang heavy on our
hands, nor were we ever dull for a moment, even
when we returned from convoy work at two
o'clock in the morning. We would then have
dinner together, and Gye was such a wonderful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
story-teller, and Claude Rolo was such a good
second, and he also possessed such an infectious
laugh, that I have often literally fallen from the
box on which I was sitting, convulsed with merriment.
I am sure the men of L Battery, R. H.
A., who were camped close by, must have wondered
what all this unseemly racket was about at
such unearthly hours of the morning.</p>

<p>Gye's knowledge of colloquial Arabic was
profound. It is related of him in Egypt that a
Cairo street loafer on one occasion maliciously
annoyed him, whereupon Gye turned upon him
and let loose such a flood of Arabic slang, minutely
vituperating the fellow himself and his
ancestors for fourteen generations back, that,
despairing of ever reaching such heights of eloquence,
the loafer, out of sheer envy, went
straight away and hanged himself!</p>

<p>In this first little bivouac of ours I spread my
ground sheet and blanket in the corner of what
had been a house. The guns of the Fleet had
evidently got on to it and now nothing was left
standing but some of the walls, which in places
were about three or four feet high.</p>

<p>A day or two after settling in here I happened
to jump down from one of these walls and the
ground gave way somewhat under me. We<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
made an excavation into it and discovered, hidden
away in an underground chamber, an old green
silk flag, so ancient that a touch rent it, an antiquated
battle-axe dating, I should say, from
the time of the Crusaders, and also some antique
brass candlesticks&mdash;a curious and rare find in
such a place.</p>

<p>It must not be supposed that the Turks left
us in peace during the day. They constantly
dropped shells into our little valley, tearing holes
in the ground all round us, but by great good
fortune while we were in this place we suffered
no casualty of any kind, either man or mule.</p>

<p>On May 1st, after nightfall, I sent Claude
Rolo out in the direction of the Gully Ravine,
with ammunition and supplies for one of the
Brigades of the 29th Division. He got to his
destination safely, but while he was unloading the
convoy, at about ten o'clock, whether by chance
or design I know not, a tremendous hail of
shrapnel was poured upon them from the Turkish
guns a couple of miles away. Some forty of
the mules had already been relieved of their loads
and many of these broke away and galloped off
into the darkness.</p>

<p>This turned out to be a providential diversion,
for they helped to save the British Army that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
night, in much the same way as the cackling geese
once saved Rome, for, all unknown to us, masses
of Turks were at that very moment creeping up
in the dark just before the rise of the moon.
They were in three lines, the first line being without
ammunition, as it was their particular business,
when they got near enough to our trenches,
to rush them with the bayonet. The Turkish
General Staff, however, had not calculated on
Zion mules! The terrified animals, scared and
wounded by the shrapnel, careered over our
trenches and clattered down with clanking chains
on the stealthy foe. The Turks undoubtedly
took them for charging cavalry, for they poured
a volley into them and thus gave away their position.</p>

<p>Our men instantly lined the trenches and
opened such an intense fire that the Turks were
utterly routed, and those of them that were left
alive fled back to the cover of their own trenches.
The battle was taken up all along the line, and,
if volume of musketry counts for anything, it was
the hottest night fight we had during all the time
we were on the Peninsula.</p>

<p>Claude Rolo had a most arduous and perilous
time collecting his men and mules in the midst of
all this turmoil, but he eventually got them together<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
and took them down a side track to the
Gully, into which they all scrambled helter-skelter,
for safety.</p>

<p>One of the men, Private Groushkousky, distinguished
himself greatly in this fight, for when
the hail of shrapnel descended on the convoy and
stampeded many of the mules, this plucky boy&mdash;for
he was a mere youth&mdash;although shot
through both arms, held on to his plunging animals
and safely delivered his loads of ammunition
to the men in the firing line. I promoted
Private Groushkousky to the rank of Corporal,
for his pluck and devotion to duty, and, in addition,
recommended him for the D.&nbsp;C.&nbsp;M., which
I am glad to say he obtained.</p>

<p>While Rolo and his men were having such a
strenuous time on the left of the line, I took a
convoy to the Brigade holding the centre. At
about two o'clock in the morning, soon after we
had returned, we were all having a much-needed
sleep, for we were worn out with constant coming
and going day and night. I was roused from
a deep slumber into which I had fallen by a messenger
to say ammunition was urgently required
by the Anson Battalion of the Royal Naval Division
and other units on the right flank of our line.
I remember what a difficult task it was to rouse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
the men, who lay about on the ground, like
rolled-up balls, in front of their mules. I found
a very effective plan was to shout loudly in their
ear: "Turks!" That, coupled with the roar of
the guns and the crackling of the rifles, quickly
brought them back to realities, and almost in the
twinkling of an eye the Zion men were loading up
cartridges with feverish speed at the Ordnance
Depot, which was situated not many yards below
our lines. I always kept our mules saddled
throughout the day and night, in relays, for I
knew that in those strenuous times I would be
likely to get a call at any moment to supply the
firing line with ammunition.</p>

<p>No matter at what hour of the day or night
we went to the ammunition stack, Major Howell
Jones, the Chief Ordnance Officer of the 29th
Division, was always on the spot to issue it; and
not only was he there, but if there was any
"push" on, he turned to and helped to load up
the mules with his own hands. He was one of
the hardest-worked men on the Peninsula, and
I sincerely hope that the 29th Division realises
all it owes to his energy and foresight.</p>

<p>In those early days after the first landing, when
we were pressing the Turks so steadily before
us, and we all expected that one final push would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
drive them over Achi Baba, the Zionists petitioned
General Hunter-Weston to be permitted
to take part in the assault. After some consideration,
the General refused to let us go, saying
that we were performing invaluable services in
keeping the men in the trenches supplied with
ammunition and food. Although we were denied
officially the privilege of actually taking part
in the attack, yet unofficially some of the Corps,
at least, had the gratification of joining battle
with the Turks.</p>

<p>It must be remembered that our troops had
suffered terrible losses in those early battles, and
the Inniskilling Fusiliers had fared no better than
the rest, and they had very few men indeed with
which to man their trenches in the event of an
attack. Now it so happened that the Turks
made a determined onslaught upon them on one
occasion, when a party of the Zion Mule Corps
was close by, unloading a convoy; and these
Zionists, having the lust of battle strong in them,
and seeing how weak the Inniskillings were, left
their mules to take care of themselves and, under
the leadership of Corporal Hildersheim, leaped
into the trenches and materially assisted in repelling
the Turks.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>

<h3>LIFE IN OUR NEW CAMP</h3>


<p>More and more troops kept on disembarking and
within fourteen days we found ourselves being
crowded out of our little valley that ran up from
the sea, and it became a pressing necessity to look
out for fresh quarters further inland. Nor were
we sorry to move, for a road had been made close
to our lines, which, owing to the great traffic
upon it, was now several inches deep in fine
white dust, which blew over us in choking clouds.</p>

<p>At this time, the whole of the Peninsula, from
Cape Helles to Achi Baba, was one expanse of
green pastures and cultivation, and the country
looked exceedingly pretty. Quantities of beautiful
flowers grew everywhere, so much so that
some fields were a regular blaze of colour, the
western slopes of Achi Baba itself being beautified
by gorgeous stretches of blood-red poppies.
Groves of trees of various kinds were dotted
about, while the olive and the almond flourished
everywhere. Here and there were to be seen
round, masonry-topped wells, just like those pictured<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
in illustrated Bibles, showing Rebecca
drawing water for Abraham's servant&mdash;but, alas,
here there was no Rebecca!</p>

<p>Before we left it, this smiling land became the
most desolate, God-forsaken place that it is possible
to imagine&mdash;nothing but row upon row of
unsightly trenches, and not a single blade of grass
anywhere to meet the eye.</p>

<p>For our new encampment I chose a level green
field, some two miles inland, and into this we
moved on May 11th.</p>

<p>A beautiful olive tree grew and threw a grateful
shade by the edge of our encampment, and
here, practically under its roots, we excavated a
shallow dug-out and erected over it a shelter of
canvas. Gye, Rolo and I settled ourselves in
as comfortably as possible, and although we
thought it merely a temporary halting-place on
the way to Constantinople, we never moved
camp again, and, indeed, for over seven months
it was our home.</p>

<p>I had occasion to ride back to W Beach within
a couple of hours after quitting our first encampment,
and I heartily congratulated myself that
we had cleared out of it just in the nick of time,
for the Turks had concentrated their guns on the
place immediately after we had left. I counted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
no less than thirty holes through a piece of canvas
that was stretched over the place where we had
slept the night before. Had we still been there
we must all inevitably have been blown to smithereens!</p>

<p>At our new encampment we found, burrowed
into the ground about us, the wagon lines of B,
L and Y Batteries, R. H. A., together with the
ammunition column&mdash;in fact, our lines joined up
with L Battery, which, it will be remembered,
earned such fame, and won so many V.C.'s during
the retreat from Mons. Lieutenant Davidson
of this Battery was in charge of the wagon
lines, and, as it was Gallipoli, and he was all
alone, the haughty horse gunner did not disdain
to join the lowly Muleteers' Mess! We were
very glad to have him, as he was good, cheery,
sensible company, and he also made a fourth at
Bridge, which was our relaxation when nothing
else had to be done. It is odd, when one thinks
of it now, that we were far more interested at
times, when the game got exciting, as to who
should make the odd trick than in the Turkish
shells, which flew screaming by a few feet over
our heads, especially when one remembers that
the deflection of the guns by a hair's-breadth by
those tiresome fellows who were peppering us<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
from Achi Baba and the plains of Ilium would
have meant that, in our peaceful little dug-out,
spades would have been trumps!</p>

<p>During the course of our stay here we gradually
excavated and enlarged our dwelling and
burrowed down into the ground, making a cellar
into which we could retire in case the shelling became
too hot, but, as a matter of fact, though the
bombardment at times was hot enough to satisfy
the most desperate fire-eater, we used our bomb
proof entirely as a pantry, for which we found it
most useful.</p>

<p>No sooner had we settled down to life in our
new bivouac than the Turks began to annoy us by
dropping shells into it and disturbing our peace
of mind and body. On the morning following
our arrival, while we were having breakfast under
the spreading branches of our olive tree, a shrapnel
burst, sending its bullets unpleasantly near.
I remarked jocularly to the others that if the
next shell came any closer we should have to
move. Scarcely had I spoken when one went
bang just over us, and a bullet whizzed between
our heads and smashed through the arm of my
Orderly Room Sergeant, Abulafia, who at that
moment was standing by my side taking some
orders. It is a marvel how it missed hitting a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
member of our little mess, for we were all sitting
very close together round an upturned box which
we were using as a breakfast table.</p>

<p>The same shell wounded two other men, besides
killing and wounding half a dozen mules.
We decided that the place was too hot for us, so,
after helping our Medical Officer to dress the
wounded, we finished our breakfast on the other
side of a bank which ran along by our olive
tree.</p>

<p>I must mention here that Sergeant Abulafia
refused to have his wound dressed until the
others who were more seriously injured had first
received attention.</p>

<p>Dr. Levontin was very good in attending to
wounded men under fire, and he gave first aid to
these men and many others, often at great personal
risk; but at last the continual battering of
high explosive shells so close to his dug-out was
too much for him, and his nerves went, as did the
nerves of many others, and there was nothing for
it but to send him back to Egypt. From the
time of his departure our sick and wounded were
ministered to by Captain Blandy, R. A. M. C.,
who was the medical officer in charge of the batteries
camped round us, and the men, finding
Captain Blandy most sympathetic and painstaking,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
did not fail to avail themselves to the full
of his able services.</p>

<p>The troublesome Turks did not allow us to
keep our animals in the pleasant field where we
had, after much trouble, laid down our ropes and
pegs and made our lines.</p>

<p>From Achi Baba and the slopes above Krithia
they could see us perfectly well, and they rained
such a tornado of shells round about us, ploughing
up the ground in all directions, that I ordered
a hasty evacuation of the field and chose another
site close by, somewhat better concealed from
view by a plantation of olive trees. It was extremely
difficult to hide from the Turks as Achi
Baba dominated the whole Peninsula. Even in
our new position we were not allowed to remain
undisturbed, for almost daily the Turks peppered
us with shrapnel and high explosives, both from
Achi Baba and the Asiatic coast.</p>

<p>I set the men to work to dig themselves and the
mules well into the bowels of the earth, and in a
very short time they had done this so effectually
that a stranger visiting the place would be astonished
if he were told that some hundreds of
men and mules were concealed right under his
very nose.</p>

<p>Soon after we had evacuated the field in which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
the Turks had shelled us so vigorously it was
taken possession of by the Collingwood Battalion
of the Royal Naval Division. They arrived in
the dusk of the evening, and as they were apparently
unaware of their dangerous position, I
felt it to be my duty to go and warn the Commanding
Officer, Captain Spearman, R. N., how
exposed the place was, and how they would probably
be plastered by high explosives as soon as the
Turks discovered them on the following morning.
Captain Spearman was very glad to be given this
friendly warning and, in consequence, he made
his Battalion dig itself well in, and for several
hours into the night I could hear pick and spade
digging and delving. It was well they did so,
for on the following morning a brisk bombardment
opened on them, but, thanks to the precautions
which they had taken, they, on that day at
all events, suffered no casualties.</p>

<p>It was very funny to see the men sitting in rows
along the banks of earth thrown up out of their
"dug-outs" and watch them dive, like rabbits into
their burrows, at the sound of an approaching
shell; then, after the explosion, every one popped
up again to see what damage had been done.</p>

<p>During the time they were camped there a shell
would now and again plump right into a dug-out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
and then, of course, the unfortunate occupants
would be blown about in little pieces all over the
place. A hand was once blown down to my horse
lines, some hundred and fifty yards away from
where the shell had burst, and shattered a man
to atoms.</p>

<p>A German Taube for a time flew over our lines
every morning long before sunrise, of course
catching all our airmen napping. These visits
were generally for observation purposes, but
sometimes the Taubes would liven us up by dropping
a few bombs. They made several shots at
the French guns, but always missed. I saw a
bomb land among a dozen French horses one
day, and all of the unfortunate animals were terribly
wounded. I never saw such shambles, for
the horses were in a dug-out close together for
safety. The Zion lines had several close escapes,
as did the Royal Naval Division Hospital which
was close to us, and where Staff-Surgeon Fleming
cheerfully and skilfully attended to our sick
and wounded at all times of the day and night.</p>

<p>The Taube is a much more vicious looking
machine than ours. It has a certain air of arrogance
about it, entirely lacking in our type of
aeroplane. It is not in the least like a dove, as
the German name signifies, but appears to me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
very like a hawk, always ready to pounce on its
prey.</p>

<p>Day by day one kept missing friendly faces.
I remember such a nice boy, belonging to one of
the Naval Battalions, who used to pass my camp
regularly with his platoon on his way to the
beach to bathe. I never knew the boy's name,
but he interested me as he was a bright, cheery,
handsome youngster, who seemed to be on the
best of terms with his men. One day there was
a vigorous bombardment of his lines, and when
next the platoon went by the young officer was
missing. He had been blown to pieces by a
shell.</p>

<p>The Royal Naval Division were a mixed crowd,
and their ways in Gallipoli were somewhat peculiar.
Their habits and customs were decidedly
"herumphroditish." They performed military
duties as ordinary Infantry; then they jumped
back and were sailors again. They kept time by
the chiming of ships' bells; when they were
wanted out of their dug-outs the boatswain would
pipe "All hands on deck"; when a company was
mustered on parade, the Commander (when the
Commodore came along!) reported "All present
on the main deck, sir"&mdash;the main deck being
along a line of dug-outs; and if one herumphrodite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
wished to visit another herumphrodite in a
different Battalion, he had to apply for "shore
leave"!</p>

<p>The Collingwood Battalion met with a very sad
end soon after their arrival in my neighbourhood.
They were sent up to take part for the first time
in an attack on the Turkish trenches, and they
were placed on our extreme right, linking up
with the French. When the order came to
charge, they went forward most gallantly, capturing,
with little loss, two of the Turkish lines of
trenches, Captain Spearman, well to the fore,
leading his men. He got shot in the foot, but,
ignoring it, dashed along, waving his hat in the
air as he cheered his men to the assault. Unfortunately,
owing to the conspicuous part he
and his officers played in the attack (and it was
necessary that they should do so, owing to the
rawness of the men), he and practically all the
other officers of the battalion were killed. Then
some one, possibly a German, for there were several
of them in the Turkish trenches round about,
shouted out the fatal word "Retire." This was
carried along the line and the men turned about
and made back, helter-skelter, for their own
trenches, but in trying to gain them they were
practically annihilated by machine-gun and rifle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
fire. I was particularly sorry for Captain
Spearman, who had come to our dug-out on many
occasions, and had drunk an early cup of coffee
with us only a few hours before he was killed.</p>

<p>In this disastrous retreat the Collingwood Battalion
was practically wiped out. The survivors
were transferred to another unit of the Royal
Naval Division and the very name of this Battalion
went out of existence.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>

<h3>A MAY BATTLE</h3>


<p>During a big battle which took place early in
May, I sent Gye forward with a large convoy of
ammunition, and on riding out later on to see
how things were going I passed over some of
the ground occupied by the French, who were
to the right of the British, and extended from
thence across the Peninsula to the Dardanelles.
A couple of miles to the rear of the fighting line
extended the batteries of the famous .75s, cunningly
concealed among trees, branches specially
planted in the ground, reeds, etc. I watched
the gunners serve their guns, and my admiration
was aroused at witnessing the ease and
celerity with which they were loaded, their mechanical
arrangement for setting the fuse, and,
above all, the beautifully smooth recoil of the barrel.
This was so nicely adjusted that I might
have placed my finger on the ground behind the
wheel of the gun and have received no damage.</p>

<p>The French Army can give us points on many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
things, but above all stands their .75 gun. They
are wonderfully accurate, marvellously quick,
and seem able to pour out from their muzzles
a continuous stream of projectiles. The French
certainly did not starve their gunners in ammunition,
and only for those .75s our position in Gallipoli
would often have been somewhat precarious.</p>

<p>After I had watched the guns in action for a
while I passed on, and going down the sandy
road which led from Sedd-el-Bahr village to
Krithia I came upon the first evidences of the
fight that was now raging. A handsome young
French artilleryman lay dead by the side of the
road; some friend had closed his eyes, and he
looked as if he merely slept, but it was the long
sleep of death. A little further on lay some
Zouaves, and yet a little further some Senegalese,
all lying just as they fell, with their packs
on their backs and their rifles close by, facing the
foe&mdash;brave French soldiers all.</p>

<p>Turning a corner I found myself riding into
General d'Amade and his staff, busily directing
the battle. Almost at the General's horse's feet
lay a Turk whose face was half blown away.
The poor fellow had wrapped the end of his pugaree
round his ghastly wound. Within a yard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
or two lay another Turk, his shoulder smashed to
pulp by a shell. Both men bore up with the
greatest fortitude and never uttered a groan. A
first-aid dressing station was close by, where
scores of wounded, French and Turks, were being
doctored and bandaged. These sights of the
uglier and sadder side of war are not pleasing,
and any one who has seen the horrors of it can
never wish to view such scenes again. I would
put all Foreign Ministers, Diplomats and Newspaper
Proprietors in the forefront of every battle
for which they were in any way responsible.
However, duty has to be done, even in the midst
of horrors, so saluting the General, I pushed
further along to the front, where I could see Gye
with the mules in the distance.</p>

<p>By the time I had cantered up to him all the
ammunition had been unloaded, and at the spot
where I halted I found myself looking over a
bank into the midst of a Battalion of cheery little
Gurkhas (the 6th) and almost within handshake
of their Commander, Colonel C. Bruce,
who was an old acquaintance of mine. I had no
idea he was in Gallipoli, and it was curious to
come upon him, after some years, in the thick of
a battle.</p>

<p>I stayed for a time chatting with him while the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
bullets and shells whizzed round&mdash;in fact, until
an order came for his Battalion to go forward
into the fight.</p>

<p>I myself went and took up a position on a hill
close by, where I could see, as if from the gallery
of a theatre, the whole fight staged before me;
where I could note the move of practically every
man and gun.</p>

<p>As I looked down from my post of observation,
a saucer-like green valley full of olive trees, vine-yards
and young corn spread out before me for
some five miles, right away up to Achi Baba, the
dominating hill, some six hundred or seven hundred
feet high. The French, as I have already
said, were away on the right, and I watched
their infantry mass in hollows and ravines, then
advance in wavy lines under the pounding shelter
of their guns. The latter were served magnificently,
and the infantry as they advanced
found the ground to their immediate front swept
yard by yard by the guns fired by their comrades
a couple of miles to their rear.</p>

<p>It was a stirring sight to watch the officers
dash out and give the men a lead when there was
any hesitation or waver of the line. In places
I could see the Turks run like hares, but on the
extreme left the French who were in touch with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
our right could be seen retiring precipitately over
the hill, badly slated by the Turks.</p>

<p>I was fascinated by the sight and wondered
how that broken line could be again reformed.
It was done, however, in the shelter of a bluff,
and once more they charged over the hill and
were then lost to my view.</p>

<p>The 29th Division extended from the French
left, near the right centre of the saucer, across
to the Ægean Sea. The front was towards Achi
Baba, and our men made headway towards it in
the face of fierce opposition. Our guns were
barking away at the Turks in their trenches, and
the great guns of the Fleet were hurling their
high explosives, which descended on the doomed
Turks with terrific effect. One could see great
spurts of flame, smoke, earth, timbers, rocks,
Turks, in fact, everything in the neighbourhood,
going up as though shot out of the crater of a
volcano.</p>

<p>To me it seemed as though nothing could possibly
live under such a reign of death, which continued
with ever-increasing intensity for an hour.
Nothing could be seen of Achi Baba, or any
other part of the Turkish position, owing to the
smoke and dust which the bombardment had
raised, and unfortunately the wind was blowing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
towards us, which brought everything into the
eyes of our men as they leaped out of the trenches
to the attack.</p>

<p>The moment the guns ceased one could discern,
through the haze, the gleam of bayonets as
the Allies swept forward along the whole front
like a bristling wall of steel, right into the leading
Turkish trenches.</p>

<p>Wherever the bombardment had done its work
and smashed down the wire entanglements, our
men found it easy to advance. Such Turks as
remained in the trenches were dazed and demoralised
by the shell fire, and were only too
willing to surrender. But in some parts, especially
on the left of the line, the guns had failed
to cut down the barbed wire, and here our men
were crumpled up by the deadly fire of rifle and
machine-gun which was concentrated on them at
this point.</p>

<p>It was a soul-stirring sight to watch, on this
great stage, the alternate advance and retreat of
our men, and the scuttle of the Turks along their
communication trenches; the charge of the
Zouaves, the hurried retirement of the Senegalese
when they were met with a terrific fire from the
Turks; the reforming of the line behind the
friendly crest; the renewed pounding of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
Turkish line by French and British guns; the
charge once more of the Allied infantry into and
through the Turkish curtain of fire until they
were swallowed up in the smoke.</p>

<p>The heart palpitated with emotion, and one's
imagination was gripped by the sight of these
gallant fellows flinging themselves recklessly at
the Turks.</p>

<p>At length human nature could do no more, and
both British and French had to call a halt.</p>

<p>The result of the battle was that we gained
some few hundred yards practically along the
whole front except on the extreme left, but it
was at a considerable cost in killed and wounded.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>

<h3>GENERAL D'AMADE AND THE CORPS EXPÉDITIONNAIRE
D'ORIENT</h3>


<p>One end of our camp was in touch with the
French lines and, of course, I saw a great deal
of the French soldiers and a little of their gallant
Commander, General d'Amade. I know, therefore,
with what feelings of regret his men heard
that he was about to return to France. He had
endeared himself by his unfailing courtesy and
goodwill, and had impressed with his fine, soldierly
qualities all those with whom he had in any
way come into contact.</p>

<p>During the tenure of his command, the French
troops had, at the point of the bayonet, wrested
seemingly impregnable positions from the brave
foe. Their losses had been cruel, terrible, but
their deeds are imperishable.</p>

<p>The military records of France make glorious
reading, but even to these dazzling pages General
d'Amade and his gallant troops have added
fresh lustre.</p>

<p>A sad blow had fallen upon the General while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
he was in Alexandria reorganising his Corps
Expéditionnaire d'Orient, prior to its departure
for Gallipoli. In the midst of his work a telegram
was handed to him announcing that his son
had fallen gloriously in France. The General,
having read the heart-breaking message, paused
for a moment and then remarked: "Well, our
work for France must go on."</p>

<p>It was my good fortune to see the order of the
day of the <i>Journal Officiel</i> du 11 Février, 1915,
which recounted the death and gallant deeds of
General d'Amade's boy. He was only eighteen
and had just joined his regiment, the 131st Infantry,
when he went on a perilous night mission
to obtain information which could only be got
by creeping up into the German trenches. With
just two men he accomplished this dangerous
duty successfully, but at that very moment he
was discovered and a volley from the enemy laid
him low. Although grievously wounded, his
first thought was for France, so, forbidding his
comrades to carry him off, he told them to fly
with all speed to the French lines with the valuable
information which he had obtained. Young
Gerard d'Amade died where he had fallen, a
noble example of that spirit of self-sacrifice which
characterises all ranks of the French Army.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
A framed copy of this order of the day has
now a place of honour in the nursery of a little
boy I know of who, every night before he goes
to bed, stands in front of it at the salute and
says: "I do this in memory of a brave French
officer who gave his life for his country. May
I so live that, if necessary, I may be ready to die
for England as nobly as Gerard d'Amade died
for France."</p>

<p>The British public is little aware of what it
owes to General d'Amade. During the terrible
retreat of our Expeditionary Force from Mons,
when we were outnumbered by five to one, and
when the Germans were closing round our small
army in overwhelming numbers, General Sir
John French sent out urgent appeals for assistance
in this hour of dire peril to the Generals
commanding the French armies on his right and
left. For some reason or other none of these
came to his aid, and for a time it looked as if our
gallant little army would be engulfed and annihilated.</p>

<p>Fortunately, there was one French General to
whom the appeal was not made in vain. This
was General d'Amade, who, at that time, was
guarding the line in the northwest of France
from Dunkerque to Valenciennes. To hold this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
very important eighty miles of front all the
troops he had were four divisions of somewhat
ill-equipped Territorials, with very few guns.
It must be remembered that the French Territorial
is past his prime and, as a rule, is the father
of a family, and considers his fighting days over.</p>

<p>It can well be imagined, therefore, what an
anxious time General d'Amade had during those
fateful days from the 19th to the 28th August,
1914, when at any moment the German avalanche
might burst upon him. On the 24th August his
force was strengthened by two Reserve Divisions
(the 61st and 62nd), which only arrived in the
nick of time, for with these he was able to
do something in answer to General French's despairing
appeal. General d'Amade man&oelig;uvred
these two Reserve Divisions into a position which
seriously threatened von Kluck's flank. That
"hacking" General, not knowing the strength of
General d'Amade's menacing force, became anxious
for his right flank and communications, so
turned aside from his pursuit of the British and
proceeded to crush the French. These two divisions
put up such an heroic fight and offered
such a stubborn resistance to the German horde
that it took the pressure off our sorely stricken
men, enabling them to extricate themselves and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
retire, broken, exhausted, tired, crushed, it is
true, but still to retire to safety, where they were
able to reorganise and take ample vengeance on
the Germans a few days later.</p>

<p>General d'Amade lost practically his entire
force, but he had gained something very precious;
he had saved our army from destruction,
and what is more, he had saved the honour of
France&mdash;nay, even France itself, for if the
French generals had stood idly by and allowed
our Expeditionary Force to be wiped out of existence,
I think it is more than likely that France
might have prayed in vain for any further assistance,
in troops at all events, from England.</p>

<p>All honour, therefore, to the General who,
without hesitation, with just two Reserve Divisions,
took the shock of the German legions and
sacrificed himself and his troops rather than see
the honour of France go down in the dust. Politicians
may recommend the bestowal of honours
and decorations on their favourite Generals, but
General d'Amade deserves more than this, he deserves
a tribute from the British people. He
made a magnificent sacrifice in our cause, and if
ever in the history of the world a general deserved
a sword of honour from a nation, General
d'Amade deserves one from England.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV</h2>

<h3>VARIOUS BOMBARDMENTS</h3>


<p>Every morning regularly the Turks commenced
shelling us punctually at eight o'clock, presumably
after they had had breakfast, and again at
tea time. They generally continued for a couple
of hours, and these hours were always lively ones
for us, and it was a daily occurrence to lose men,
horses and mules.</p>

<p>On the 16th May, eleven Frenchmen, who happened
to be close to our lines, were killed instantly
by one shell, on the 17th one of my horses
was wounded, and on the 19th the second was hit
in the ribs by shrapnel.</p>

<p>The Turks often switched off from us and
bombarded a section of the road used by wagons,
gun-teams and motor cyclists. The latter were,
to me, the chief wonder of Gallipoli. I ride a
motor cycle myself, and have had a few smashes,
so can fully realise its dangers.</p>

<p>I was introduced to this convenient form of
locomotion by Dr. Rolleston after a breakdown
in health. It is the most wonderful tonic I have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
yet come across, because the moment one gets on
to the bicycle one's attention is so centred on
keeping it going, picking out the smoothest bits
of road, avoiding collisions, etc., that I veritably
believe the treachery of one's closest friend would,
for the moment, at least, fade from the memory.
I am perfectly certain that the Gallipoli motor
cyclists never gave a thought to absent friends;
they were much too busy avoiding pitfalls and
shells. They flew over the most uneven ground,
took small trenches as it were in their stride, and
were generally the most dare-devil set of boys I
have ever seen. Many a time we stood and
watched through our glasses this dangerous strip
of road which the Turks had got the range of to
a yard. As the wagons, gun-teams and cyclists
approached it, they would get up the pace, and
fly through it at top speed. The narrow squeaks
that we constantly witnessed on this bit of road
were enough to make one's hair stand on end!
Yet I am glad to say I only once saw a man
struck down. It looked so sad&mdash;the moment before
so full of the joy of life, and then, just a
little, huddled heap, lying still and quiet on the
dusty roadway.</p>

<p>On May 20th, the Turks bombarded us for several
hours; five of my men were wounded, two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
seriously, one of the poor fellows having his leg
smashed to atoms. The same day I had five
mules and one horse killed and ten mules
wounded. The Horse Artillery, camped round
about us, also suffered rather severely, for the
Turks every now and again switched their batteries
on to their lines and caused them heavy
losses. It was a busy time for Lieutenant Fisher,
the Veterinary Surgeon of the Horse Batteries,
who kindly came to our aid whenever the Zion
mules got "strafed."</p>

<p>When this bombardment broke upon us, everybody
made a rush to get his horse, mule or himself
out of danger, and many were the curses
heaped on the Turkish gunners, who were universally
consigned to the warmest place of which
we have ever heard. It makes me laugh even
now when I think of a little comedy that took
place between Rolo and his groom. The latter,
whose name was Dabani, was a most comical looking
little fellow, with bandy legs, a swarthy face,
and little black beard sprouting in patches here
and there. He was an Israelite from Arabia,
and although an excellent fellow in many ways,
he was more renowned for his piety than for his
courage. You could always tell the intensity of
a bombardment by the fervour of Dabani's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
prayers. On this occasion, when the shells began
to burst and spatter the shrapnel all round
us, Rolo shouted to Dabani, whom he saw scuttling
off for safety, to come back and look after
his horse. "What, look after your horse now?"
cried Dabani. "This is a time when I must look
after myself," and taking not the slightest notice
of Rolo's angry maledictions, he, with rabbit-like
agility, dived for safety into his dug-out!</p>

<p>This bombardment badly shook some of my
men, and among them Schoub, my farrier, who,
the moment he felt it safe to emerge from the
nethermost depths of his dug-out, came in a state
of abject terror to Gye, begging piteously to be
sent back to the bosom of his family in Alexandria,
because, he remarked, "I am no use here
now. The shells have made me stone deaf. I
cannot hear a word." "What," said Gye, in a
low voice, "not a single word?" "Not a single
word," replied Schoub!</p>

<p>It was many months before he returned in
safety to Alexandria, and by that time bombardments
had become so common that they had
ceased to terrify.</p>

<p>On the 2nd June, I was returning with Claude
Rolo from an expedition which we had made to
the Gurkha trenches on the extreme left of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
line. Before we had got very far on our way
heavy howitzers began to bombard the Turks,
and as we were just then passing an artillery observation
post, hidden away in a cross trench, we
turned aside and went into it. From here we
could see our high explosive shells bursting with
terrific effect on the Turkish trench, which was
only about three hundred yards away. The Artillery
Observation Officer telephoned back to
the guns the result of each shot, and under his
guidance the shells soon battered down the earthworks,
pulverising everything where they fell.
Soon, however, some sharp-eyed Turkish gunner
spotted our observation post and began to plug
at us pretty rapidly. Shells hopped off the
parapet, shrapnel struck the steel shield, fuses
and fragments of all kinds thudded into the bank
behind our backs, and we seemed for the moment
to be living in a little tornado of lead and iron.
When this had continued for a few minutes, I
remarked to the gunner man: "What on earth
are the Turks trying to hit?" "Hit us, of
course," he somewhat shortly replied.</p>

<p>Now, so long as we remained here in the deep
trench we were comparatively safe, but as I
wanted to get back to camp, I thought I would
pull the gunner's leg before leaving him; he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
no idea who we were, for we were in our shirt
sleeves as usual, so I pretended to be thoroughly
scared, and said: "Good heavens, this is no
place for me!" on which he smiled the smile of a
brave man who feels pity for a poltroon. There
were some twenty yards or so of open ground to
be covered the moment we left the shelter of the
observation post, and, of course, this was a really
dangerous strip, because it was exposed to the
fire of the Turks, and had therefore to be covered
at top speed. The only way of accomplishing
this in safety was to do it in between the shells,
and as there was only a couple of seconds between
each, the plunge out had to be made the
instant one burst, so as to be under cover before
the next arrived. Warning Rolo to follow me
after the next explosion, out we darted. We
had almost reached safety when I heard coming
after us the scream of an approaching shell. I
shouted out to Rolo, "Jump for your life!" and
at the same time threw myself down, and the last
thing I saw, amid the dust kicked up by the
shower of shrapnel bullets, was Rolo plunging
head foremost into a ditch, as if he were taking a
dive!</p>

<p>We were neither of us hurt, but a stone thrown
up by the shell struck me on the hand and drew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
a little blood. We both congratulated ourselves
on our lucky escape and got back to camp with
whole skins, none the worse for our close shave.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI</h2>

<h3>THE COMING OF THE GERMAN SUBMARINES</h3>


<p>In our nightly journeys back from the trenches
we were always guided through the darkness to
our camp by the brilliant glare of the lights from
the warships, hospital ships and transports, which
lay thickly clustered round Cape Helles. It was
a most beautiful sight, like a veritable floating
Venice, but it was not practical and it was not
war. It showed an arrogance and utter contempt
of the enemy who was, at that very moment,
stealthily stalking them under the seas with
the deadly submarine.</p>

<p>At all events, the submarines came, with the
result that the battleships <i>Goliath</i> and <i>Triumph</i>
were sunk with appalling swiftness and great loss
of life.</p>

<p>Then, and then only, did the Fleet awaken to
its danger; the battleships and cruisers vanished
into the unknown, while the transports disappeared
in a night, and we felt, as it were, marooned
on this inhospitable Peninsula, from
which the Turks had removed every living thing,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
save only a few dogs, which were found to be so
dangerous that they had to be shot at sight.</p>

<p>It was, therefore, with feelings of great pleasure
that, as I rode down to W Beach on the evening
of the 26th May, I saw the stately battleship,
the <i>Majestic</i>, lying at anchor out in the
roadstead, a few cable lengths from W Beach;
and as I looked my heart grew glad within me,
because there lay the ship in the open sea, exposed
to any attack, and I felt that it would be
impossible for the ship to lie thus unless the
German submarines which had sunk the other
battleships a few days previously were either disposed
of, or else some clever new defence had
been designed which made the <i>Majestic</i> immune
from the deadly torpedo.</p>

<p>It was a cheering thought, and it helped to enhance
the beauty of the wondrous panorama
which lay spread before my eyes.</p>

<p>Away to my left stood the quaint old ruined
walls and towers of Sedd-el-Bahr, thrown into
bold outline against the rippling waters of the
Dardanelles, while further on the eye was caught
by the green plains of Ilium, set in a tangle of
hills, on the picturesque Asiatic coast. Ahead of
me, to the south, glittered the soft sea, with Cape
Helles jutting into it, like a rough brown hand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
thrust into a basin of shimmering quicksilver.
Almost at my feet lay Lancashire Landing, busy
with its hundreds of men and animals going to
and fro, while away on my right sparkled the
Ægean, with the Isles of Greece jutting out of
it, like rugged giants rising from their ocean lair.
To crown all, the sun was going down in a perfect
blaze of colour, tipping the crests of Imbros
and Samothrace with a glint of gold, as it sank
behind them into the sea. I have seen sunsets
in many parts of the world, but never have I seen
anything to equal the glorious lights and shades
which at sundown are painted on the Ægean sky.
If I were an artist, my ambition would be to go
in the lovely autumn days on a pilgrimage to
these shores and humbly try to put on my canvas
the perfectly gorgeous but harmoniously blended
rose, pink, scarlet, red, yellow, purple, green, amber
and blue&mdash;a perfect intoxication of glorious
colours which the imagination would be unequal
to, unless they were absolutely thrown on the sky
before one's own eyes. The magnificence of the
sunsets seen from Gallipoli were the sum of what
an ordinary mortal could conceive as a fitting
setting for the splendour of God's Throne.</p>

<p>So it is to be hoped that the officers and crew of
the <i>Majestic</i>, which was moored so peacefully<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
amid such heavenly surroundings, took a soul-satisfying
view of the glory around them, because,
alas, for many of the poor fellows it was
the last sunset that would ever gladden their eyes,
for on the morning of the 27th the ship was
marked down by a German submarine and sent
to its doom within four minutes of being struck.</p>

<p>I was attending to some routine work in my
camp when I heard the terrific explosion and,
looking up, saw a volume of smoke ascending to
the heavens from W Beach. I jumped on my
horse, which was ready saddled close by, and
galloped over to hear what had happened.
When I topped the rise, all of the <i>Majestic</i> that
I could see was a couple of dozen feet of its copper
keel which projected above the water, and
which still remains thus&mdash;a mute witness to the
fact that "some one had blundered."</p>

<p>Regrettable incidents like these should be unknown
in a Navy renowned for the good practical
commonsense and thoroughness of its captains.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII</h2>

<h3>TRENCH WARFARE IN GALLIPOLI</h3>


<p>"From all forms of trench warfare, preserve us,
O Lord!" should be the humble prayer of every
soldier, for it is about the most unpleasant, tiresome,
humdrum, disagreeable, dangerous, death-without-glory
kind of warfare which the evil
genius of man could devise. As, however, it has
come to stay, it may perhaps be of interest to
describe what it was like in Gallipoli.</p>

<p>When, after the first battles, the Turks refused
any longer to meet us in the open, and took
to the trenches, which they had, with great
energy, dug right across the Peninsula, it became
necessary for us to adopt the same mole-like
tactics, and our advance was brought practically
to a standstill. Instead of going ahead a
couple of miles in a day's fight, it now became a
question of taking one trench at a time, and often
we did not gain as much as that, even after the
most strenuous battles.</p>

<p>Long lines of trenches, from three to six or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
more feet deep, and three or four feet wide, were
dug in zig-zags right across the Peninsula, more
or less parallel to the Turkish lines, and behind
these were similar support and reserve trenches;
at the back of these again were second and third
line defence trenches; while still further were
the so-called rest trenches, but in Gallipoli these
were just as dangerous as the front trenches,
owing to the confined space in which the army
was cooped up, and also owing to the configuration
of the ground, which exposed them to fire
from Achi Baba as well as from the guns in Asia.
Some of our trenches were so deep that hundreds
of scaling ladders were always kept in readiness
to enable the men to swarm out quickly when an
assault was to be made. Long lines of communication
trenches ran up and down and to
and fro, connecting the various lines of trenches,
and many of these were dug deep enough and
wide enough to give ample cover for mules and
horses. Various little back alleys were also dug
in different directions, so that the whole face of
the country was transformed into a veritable rabbit
warren. These communication trenches were
necessary so that reliefs, reinforcements, munitions,
food and water could be taken up in safety
to the firing line.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
Where the ground was very hard and deep
trenches could not be dug, the necessary cover
was given by building parapets made of sandbags,
little canvas bags about two feet long and
ten inches across, which could easily be carried
by one man when filled with sand or clay. These
sandbags should be of different colours, because
otherwise when one is taken out to make a loophole
the blank space is seen at once and the
enemy's fire is concentrated on it. In Gallipoli
our sandbags were all of the same colour&mdash;drab-coloured
canvas.</p>

<p>When an attack was made and an enemy's
trench was captured, thousands of these sandbags
were carried forward, and by piling them up a
new protective trench was rapidly constructed,
for, of course, the original Turkish trench was
always battered to pieces (or should have been)
by high explosive shells before the attack was
launched.</p>

<p>Another great use of the sandbag was to
erect a barrier across an enemy communication
trench, otherwise, of course, he could pour his
troops down the communication alley and perhaps
effect a surprise. It was exceedingly odd
to see our sentry on one side of such a barrier
and the Turkish sentry on the other side, apparently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
quite friendly in the intervals of bombing
each other!</p>

<p>One day a man of the Inniskilling Fusiliers
played a trick on the Turkish sentry. Finding
life rather monotonous, and being somewhat fed
up with bully beef, he bored a hole in his tin,
stuck a cartridge into it, and hurled the novel
projectile over the sandbag barrier among the
Turks, who could be heard flying for their lives
away from it along the trench, evidently thinking
it was some new form of diabolical bomb we
had invented. Then one man, a little bolder
than the rest, could be heard cautiously stalking
it; he even threw stones at it, and when these
failed to cause an explosion, he plucked up
enough courage to hook it towards him with his
fixed bayonet. It was apparently sent off for
investigation to some German professor in the
rear, for some few hours later the Turkish sentry
shouted out loudly over the parapet: "Bully
beef, bully beef; throw us more," and this little
incident led to many friendly exchanges of bully
or cigarettes.</p>

<p>Life in the trenches when no "strafe" was on
was very monotonous&mdash;dull, weary watching
and waiting, with dust blowing into one's eyes
and mouth and nose all the time, and flies everywhere.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
While in the trenches food had to be
snatched when it was possible to get it. It was
cooked some considerable distance to the rear and
was then carried up to the trenches in great pots
and there distributed, and in Gallipoli, of course,
that meant dividing it between men and flies&mdash;the
latter getting the lion's share during the
months of June, July and August.</p>

<p>Of course, work was always going on. The
trenches had to be carefully drained and sloped
so as to allow the rainfall to flow off. If this
were not properly done they would inevitably be
flooded out in the rains, and life in them would
be impossible. Even when every care was taken
they sometimes became raging torrents. Much
ground was made good by digging out from the
trenches towards the Turkish lines and forming
a fresh line of trenches closer to the enemy and
in a better position.</p>

<p>Every yard in front of the trenches was
guarded by barbed wire, sometimes left unrolled
on the ground, where it naturally goes into coils
and traps for the unwary, and sometimes interlaced
on stakes, like a regular wire fencing,
doubled many times. It was very dangerous
work putting up this form of defence, and it was
generally done at night, but even then the enemy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
could see our men by the light of the brilliant
flares which were constantly sent up, for these
remained in the air for several seconds, making
everything as bright as day. The only chance
of escape then was to lie flat down and remain
perfectly still until the flare went out.</p>

<p>Then there was the constant arduous and dangerous
labour of sapping, <i>i. e.</i>, tunnelling underground
from our trenches underneath the Turkish
trenches, making a huge cavity there, filling
it with explosives and blowing the trench and
such Turks as were in it sky high. This was
generally done when an attack was made, so as
to throw the enemy into greater confusion.</p>

<p>At night it was usual to man the front trenches
fairly strongly, one-third of the force always being
awake and on the look-out for the enemy.</p>

<p>Of course, it was almost certain death for a
man to stand up and show his head and shoulders
above the parapet line, so the watch on the enemy
was kept by men with periscopes, who could
see every move in perfect safety. Even the
periscopes were often shattered to pieces by the
bullets of the Turks, which shows that some of
them were good marksmen.</p>

<p>Telephone wires were laid everywhere in the
trenches, and telephone operators and observing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
officers were scattered up and down the line.
On the first sign of an enemy attack these officers
communicated with their Batteries in the
rear, and within two seconds a curtain of fire was
rained on the advancing foe, which, in most cases,
he found it quite impossible to get through. If
he ever succeeded, however, the Infantry were by
this time lining the parapets, ready to mow down
the enemy with rifle and machine-gun fire, so the
only marvel is that any of the assaulting force
ever got through. A very rare occurrence&mdash;and
those that did pierce the line never again got
back to their own trenches.</p>

<p>One day I went up to visit Lieutenant Davidson,
who was Forward Observing Officer, and
he, having occasion to fire a gun, telephoned to
the Battery; it was a distinctly weird feeling to
hear the scream of the shell from the guns two
miles back flying close over our heads into the
Turkish trenches in front of us, almost before
Davidson had ceased speaking! At that same
observation post, on a previous day, another R.
H. A. officer, Lieutenant Perceval, who also was
a member of our little mess, had a very narrow
escape. A Turkish shell came through, slightly
bruised his shoulder, and killed his Bombardier,
who was, at the moment, holding the telephone.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
In the side of the trench next the enemy little
niches were excavated where men could lie and
sit fairly well sheltered from wind and rain.
These recesses were often used by the Turks as
burial places for their dead. I remember on one
occasion I was walking along a piece of the line
which we had just taken from the Turks when
a shell exploded close to the trench. The concussion
shook away some loose earth and out
from the side of the trench popped a dead hand
and arm!&mdash;just as if a policeman had put out
his hand to stop the traffic. The dead Turk
seemed to try, even in death, to bar the way to
an enemy's approach.</p>

<p>A very disagreeable feature of trench life is
the unpleasant odour of the dead, which penetrates
everywhere, for, of course, when an attack
is made by one side or the other hundreds may be
killed close to the trenches, and as a rule it is
impossible either to rescue the wounded or to
bury the dead, because the enemy would inevitably
shoot down any one attempting such a
task.</p>

<p>One of the very worst trials of trench warfare
is to see the dead body of a comrade lying
out in the open, gradually fading away before
one's eyes, a mummied hand still clutching the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
rifle, the helmet a little way off, looking ever so
weird in its gruesome surroundings.</p>

<p>While in the trenches one is, of course, subject
at all times to shells, rifle fire, mine explosions,
poison gas, bombs, liquid fire, and other
diabolical inventions. The Turks, however, did
not use either poison gas or liquid fire, and, of
course, neither did the British.</p>

<p>Worst trial of all is the trench mortar! This
venomous weapon sends a bomb weighing a hundred
pounds or more of the most deadly high explosive
plumb into the midst of a trench with
marvellous accuracy at any range up to four
hundred yards. The vicious thing can be seen
soaring high up into the air, until it reaches a
point directly overhead, then it hovers for a moment,
like a hawk over its prey, and finally
swoops down, pulverising everybody and everything
near which it explodes.</p>

<p>From my own observation of trench warfare
I would say unhesitatingly that no assault should
be launched against the enemy until his trenches
had been thoroughly pounded to pieces by high
explosive, his men demoralised by a constant
stream of shells, and all wire entanglements or
other barriers swept out of the way of the advance.
Then, and then only, should the infantry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
attack be launched, but before doing so the supports
and reserves should be brought up as close
as possible to the firing line, because, in these
days especially, the speed with which an assault
can be reinforced makes all the difference between
victory and defeat.</p>

<p>During the assault the guns should be constantly
playing on the reserve trenches of the
enemy, the counter batteries (<i>i. e.</i>, those batteries
told off to dominate enemy batteries) firing as
fast as they possibly can to keep down enemy
shrapnel fire and generally supporting the attack
in every possible way. Special groups
should always be told off (not single individuals)
with orders to signal back to the batteries
the position which the front line has reached in
the assault, otherwise&mdash;and I have seen it happen
more than once&mdash;our own guns will be found
playing on our own men.</p>

<p>It is unwise to trust to telephone wires for
passing signals back to the batteries, for they are
often cut by shells or broken by passing troops.
Aeroplanes fitted with wireless are most useful.
Another good plan is to fasten some very conspicuous
object, such as a large tin disc, to the
backs of the men, so that the gunners would always
be able to tell at whom they were firing.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
The disc should be tied so that the men could
switch it round to the front if they were forced
to retire. This plan was adopted in Gallipoli
towards the end of July with excellent results,
for our men could always be made out by the
flashing of the tin, which, of course, the enemy
could not see.</p>

<p>Bombs should always be carried with the assaulting
columns, and the bomb throwers should
not be hampered by a rifle, but should only be
armed with revolver and bayonet, for when their
stock of bombs is expended there are always
plenty of rifles lying around belonging to the
dead and badly wounded.</p>

<p>When all these arrangements have been completed,
and a combined attack is made with shells,
machine-guns, rifle fire, trench mortars, poison
gas, liquid fire, etc., the attack is almost certain
to succeed at some point or other, and once the
defender's line is broken his whole line is threatened,
and if the reserves are brought up and
poured quickly enough into the breach, so as to
get a wedge in between the enemy's forces, his
army can then be smashed up in detail and a
great victory won.</p>

<p>Cavalry can then burst through and once more
come into their own by playing havoc with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
enemy's line of communication. Of course, in
Gallipoli we had no Cavalry; at least, such
mounted men as we had came as Infantry without
horses! and I must say that they fought well,
those yeomen from Bucks and Kent&mdash;the only
pity is that we did not have more of them.
When we did make a breach in the enemy's line,
we never had enough troops to push through and
so ensure a crushing victory.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">GUNS AND STAFF</span></h3>


<p>The losses which we suffered in every attack on
the Turkish trenches were very severe, and it was
painful to see our men frittered away time after
time in these hopeless assaults on what had now
become an impregnable position&mdash;impregnable
at all events to such forces as we could launch to
the attack. Our casualties at the original landing
had reduced the 29th Division to a mere skeleton.
Many of the Battalions were not a company
strong and had scarcely any officers left,
and it was found necessary to join the remnants
of two or three together to make one rather weak
Battalion. The Dublins and Munsters were
thus linked up together and were officially known
as the "Dubsters."</p>

<p>Reinforcements only came in by driblets, and
as they came they were eaten up in futile attacks
on the strong trenches which the Turks had meanwhile,
with great energy, dug right across the
Peninsula.</p>

<p>We were never really strong enough to undertake
a serious offensive, and our guns never had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
ammunition enough to prepare the way properly
by a devastating bombardment. Half an hour
or an hour was usually about all we were able to
do in the way of knocking the Turkish trenches
about with high explosive, whereas these same
trenches needed a steady rain of shells for several
days to crumple them up and destroy the scores
of machine-guns which bristled everywhere.
Trench warfare seemed to have taken us completely
by surprise; we were without trench mortars,
but luckily were able to borrow some from
the French; neither had we any bombs or hand
grenades, except such as we could manufacture
locally out of jam tins!</p>

<p>No battery commander was allowed to fire a
single round unless he had first obtained permission
from his Brigadier, and even when a couple
of battalions of Turkish troops well within range
could be observed marching in column, the Brigadier
was compelled to limit the battery to two
rounds only, for to such dire straits were we reduced
owing to lack of ammunition!</p>

<p>Even with the slight support given by the guns
I have seen our gallant fellows time after time
leap out of their trenches and, in an irresistible
onslaught with the bayonet, sweep over trench
upon trench full of Turkish soldiers. Nowhere<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
could the enemy stand up to our men in the open,
as was proved over and over again in the early
days of the fight before they took to trench warfare.
If only we had had enough ammunition
and one more Division, equal to the 29th, we
would have retrieved the initial mistake of landing
at Helles, and have swept the Turks over
Achi Baba from their positions round the Narrows,
and Constantinople itself would have been
in our grip within a month.</p>

<p>But, alas! we hadn't the ammunition and we
hadn't the men; and when the Turks took to mole
tactics, and protected their front with those two
inventions of the Evil One&mdash;barbed wire and
machine-guns&mdash;our case, considering the means
at our disposal, was a hopeless one.</p>

<p>During a fierce battle which took place in June,
I was standing close to one of our batteries in
position, just south of the Pink Farm, and what
a contrast it was to see these guns in action after
having repeatedly watched the French .75s!
Here was no smooth barrel-recoil, but a clumsy
spade stuck in the ground to prevent the piece
from kicking. Whenever the gun was fired it
jumped back like a bucking bronco, necessitating
the relaying of the gun after each shot.</p>

<p>We have better guns than that now, of course,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
but with all our mechanical superiority and mechanical
resources we should years ago have had
a gun equal, or superior, to the French .75. Of
course there is no use in having a quick-firing gun
if you cannot have mountains of ammunition
alongside of it, and this point should never be
lost sight of by the Staff, whose duty it is to look
after such matters.</p>

<p>As we were very short of high explosive shells
the battery was not doing a great deal of firing,
and in the lull a Staff Officer rode up and told
the Battery Commander to lay his guns on to
some Turks whom he pointed out, saying they
were threatening our line.</p>

<p>Now I had been watching this part of the battlefield
most carefully through my glasses, and I
had seen our own men advance and go into the
position which the Staff Officer said was held by
the Turks. I overheard his instructions to the
gunner officer, so I called out: "Those are our
men, not Turks!" However, in spite of my
warning, a couple of rounds were loosed off, and
they were only too well placed, for they exploded
among our unfortunate troops, doing, no doubt,
a considerable amount of damage, because, in a
moment, a wrathful telephone message came to
the Battery Commander telling him to cease fire<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
instantly, on which the discreet Staff Officer
made a hurried departure.</p>

<p>While we had some excellent Staff Officers,
there were others not exactly noted for their brilliancy,
and no doubt the Turks saw that some of
our "regrettable incidents" were due to bad Staff
work, and the following story was vouched for
by the Peninsula wag.</p>

<p>It had been noted with some surprise that,
though the Turkish sniper exacted his toll from
all other ranks, the Staff appeared to be immune.
At last the mystery was solved when one of these
sharpshooters was captured, for on being asked
how it was that the Staff always escaped, he
replied: "Oh, well, you see, I get five shillings
for every private I shoot, ten shillings for every
sergeant, a pound for every officer, but if I were
to shoot a Staff Officer I would be shot myself!"</p>

<p>I need hardly say that these merry quips made
at the expense of the Staff by our frolicsome wits
should be taken with a grain of salt. So far as
my own experience goes, the Staff Officers of the
29th Division, and, later, of the 8th Army Corps,
were all that could be desired, and at them no such
gibe could be levelled. All those with whom I
came in contact were very much all there at their
respective jobs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
There is no doubt, however, that there is some
reason for the general lack of confidence in the
Staff. Responsible positions are unfortunately
too often given to most unsuitable men, with regrettable
results.</p>

<p>Glaring instances of jobbery and favouritism
are so universally known that it is unnecessary to
quote examples. Puck must be having the time
of his life. If only our responsible administrators
would for the future abjure nepotism (vain
wish!) and give proved talent a chance, we should,
I am convinced, have something better to show
than "strategic retreats" and "brilliant evacuations."</p>

<p>I am reminded of an incident that occurred
when I was staying with Colonel Roosevelt
during the time he was President of the United
States. An influential and well-known Senator
came into the room while I was there, and urged
on the President the claims of a <i>protégé</i> of his to
a post as Mining Inspector. President Roosevelt's
reply impressed me very much: "Well,
Senator, if your man is the best Mining Engineer
that can be found in the United States he
shall get the job, but not otherwise; he will have
the lives of men in his hands."</p>

<p>Mark this, ye jobbites of England!</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">VISITS TO THE TRENCHES</span></h3>


<p>During one of the hot June days Gye and I
paid a visit to Colonel Bruce and his Gurkhas,
who were holding the left of the line down by the
Ægean Sea.</p>

<p>The Gurkhas have done some splendid work
in the Peninsula. They are in their element
when out at night doing reconnoitring work.
Bruce told me of the valuable report brought in
by one of his N. C. O.'s, on the strength of which
he took his men up the side of a cliff and was able
to surprise and drive the Turks out of a very
strong position which it was of prime importance
we should hold. Other troops had several times
attempted this feat, but failed because they attacked
in the open, while the Gurkhas succeeded
owing to good reconnoitring work.</p>

<p>The night previous to our visit the Turks had
made a most determined attack on the Gurkhas,
and the Gurkhas asked for no better sport.
Flares, shot up by our officers, showed the Turks
advancing in regular parade formation in line of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
columns. As soon as the Turks saw that they
had been observed, they charged, yelling their
war cry: "Allah, Allah!" The Gurkhas waited
patiently, lining the trenches as thickly as they
could stand. They allowed the Turks to approach
within about fifty yards of them and then
opened such a hurricane of rifle and machine-gun
fire that the Turks were absolutely crumpled up
in ranks as they stood. The fury of the Gurkhas
was now thoroughly aroused and, the reserves
having been brought up, the whole brigade made
such an onslaught that practically not a single
Turk out of that huge attacking force ever got
back to his own trench.</p>

<p>When Rolo and I viewed the battlefield within
a few hours of the fight, there were still some
wounded to be seen in the intervening ground between
the two forces, while in regular battle array
lay line upon line of Turkish dead, silent witnesses
to the terribly accurate fire poured into
them by the Gurkhas. They are brave fellows,
those Turks, and it was a sad sight to see so many
gallant men laid low.</p>

<p>No doubt in revenge for the defeat they had
suffered the previous night, the Turks were bombarding
the Gurkha lines vigorously, and while I
was there they landed a big "Black Maria" shell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
underneath a little fellow who was squatting on
his heels outside his dug-out. It was an extraordinary
sight to see him shoot down the hill in this
position and land some forty feet away in a
clump of bushes, from which he emerged not
much the worse for his involuntary flight.</p>

<p>The Gurkhas, in one of their previous attacks
on the heights occupied by the Turks, were held
up by some barbed wire and had to retire. A
private soldier, however, chose to remain behind,
ensconced under the scanty protection of a couple
of knapsacks, which he pulled together from
those strewn round, thinking that he could hold
his own until another assault was delivered by
his comrades, when he would join them. No
comrades came, however, so he found himself
unable to move without being observed. He
therefore pretended to be dead and lay absolutely
still for hours, not even daring to move
his head, except when his neck got very stiff,
and then only by pushing his hat up a fraction of
an inch, so that he might slowly twist his head inside
it without showing any movement. At last
he could stand the strain no longer, so he leaped
up, raced in a zig-zag to his own trenches amid a
hail of bullets, and, carefully avoiding a low spot
where the Turks had concentrated their fire, expecting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
him to go in that way, he leaped over the
highest part of the parapet and escaped scot-free.</p>

<p>I saw this little fellow a few hours after his
exploit and he looked as though he had thoroughly
enjoyed the adventure.</p>

<p>A few days after the big Turkish assault I was
again on my way to this part of the line, when I
happened to meet General de Lisle, and, on mentioning
that I was going to see Colonel Bruce, he
told me I would not find him, for he had been
wounded on the previous night by a bomb, while
gallantly leading his men.</p>

<p>I had several friends in the Inniskilling Fusiliers
and frequently I came across them in my
journeys to and from the Gurkha lines. As a
rule, they held the trenches to the right of the little
brown men from Nepaul.</p>

<p>I always made a point, when I was anywhere
near, of looking up Captain Gordon Tillie. He
was now practically the only officer left of the
Inniskillings who had taken part in the original
landing and had, so far, escaped scot-free. I was
hopeful that his luck would see him through, because
he had only been married a few days before
he left England for the front, and I knew his wife
very well, and had promised her to look him up
whenever I had an opportunity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
Just before the 29th Division went to Suvla,
Gye and I paid him a visit, while he was holding
the front trenches, and, sad to say, this was the
last occasion on which I ever saw Gordon Tillie.
He took us along that portion of the trench for
which his company was responsible, and showed
us the various points of interest in the Turkish
line, which, at this particular place, was sometimes
parallel, and sometimes almost at right
angles to our trenches, and in places only a dozen
yards distant. When I was leaving him he cautioned
me to be careful of a certain part of the
trench we should have to pass through, as he said
it was exposed to the Turkish guns and they often
gave it a "strafing." My parting remark to him
was: "Take care they don't 'strafe' you."</p>

<p>Of course, shells were dropping here and there
all the time from the Turkish guns, and they were
paying some attention to the piece of dangerous
trench which Gye and I were bound to go
through, so, saying to him: "Let's make a bolt
for it," we started off at our best pace, but before
we got through we had to lie down in the bottom
of the trench to escape a couple of shells which
burst all round us and knocked to pieces the sandbag
parapet protecting our heads.</p>

<p>Gordon Tillie's friendly warning may have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
saved our lives, and it is a nice thought, for, soon
afterwards, the 29th Division were sent to Suvla,
and there Captain Tillie was killed while gallantly
leading his company up the slopes of Sari
Bair&mdash;a brave soldier, as Sir Ian Hamilton testifies
in his Suvla Bay Despatch.</p>

<p>I often made an expedition to visit a friend,
only to find, when I got there, that he had perhaps
been killed the day before, or else had been sent
off to hospital badly wounded, and it was sad to
see how one's friends gradually got thinned off.
Many of them lay buried all round. One would
suddenly be startled by coming across a freshly-dug
grave in some sheltered little nook by the
wayside and learn for the first time, from the rude
cross erected over it, that one's friend lay there.
But war is war, and as a shell or bullet may come
at any moment and bring sudden death with it to
one's self, one gets used to the idea, and somehow
it does not seem so dreadful. Many of us often
escaped by the merest chance. In my own case
the turning aside to pluck a flower, or straying a
little from the path to get a better view of a sunset,
was the chance that prevented Death from
finding me, because more than once I have seen a
shell explode and excavate a huge hole on the
exact spot where, had I not turned aside, I would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
undoubtedly have been standing. Yes, indeed,
in those days, one often heard, sounding softly
in one's ears, the faint rustle of the wings of the
Angel of Death.</p>

<p>I do not know whether the Turks had any particular
spite against my Zionists, but they certainly
gave us more than our fair share of shells.
One afternoon they began a bombardment and
plumped a shell into a bank on which sat a Zion
man, Private Scorobogaty. The explosion sent
him some feet into the air, but, beyond the bruise
and shock, he suffered no damage. The next
shell dropped plump in the middle of our little
supply of stores, within six feet of the door of our
dug-out, and sent everything flying through
space. A third shot plunged into the roots of a
tree which stood close to our lines, by which the
trumpeter of L Battery, R. H. A., was standing.
He heard the shell coming, and, without any
particular reason, but luckily for him, he made a
dive to the right instead of to the left, and so
escaped for the moment. Next afternoon at
tea-time another shell came, cut the same tree
clean in two, wounding the trumpeter and two
other men of L Battery, who were having their
tea in its shade.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XX</h2>

<h3>FLIES, DUST AND BATTLE</h3>


<p>July was a scorching month, and to add to the
discomfort of heat there was a plague of flies;
flies, flies, flies everywhere, and I have no doubt
that they were responsible for the serious epidemics
which broke out among the troops.
Doubtless it was the self-same pestilence which
Homer tells us attacked the Grecian Army
camped round Troy, and which they attributed to
the anger of Apollo, though none of our mules
suffered as did those of the Greeks.</p>

<p>These flies were disgusting, horrible pests, for
they would come straight from the rotting
corpses of the Turks, which lay in unburied hundreds
in front of our trenches, and blacken every
scrap of food on which they could obtain a foot-hold.
The only way to get a clean bite into one's
mouth, without taking the flies with it, was to
blow vigorously all the time until the lips had
actually closed on the morsel, and even then
these pests would hover round, waiting for a
chance opening to dart in and chase it down.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
The dust, too, in these days was very trying, for
the whole peninsula was now one vast dust heap,
which the slightest wind would swirl about in
blinding, choking clouds. I noticed that on several
occasions our men had to do battle with this
dust storm blowing directly in their eyes, so that
it was impossible to see anything in front of them,
while the Turks, with their backs to it, could see
our men coming along plainly enough and could
slate them at their leisure. I always found, as
was to be expected, that when we foolishly attacked
on such days as these we effected nothing
beyond getting ourselves killed. The Turks
must have marvelled at our blind folly.</p>

<p>I well remember that one of our most successful
battles was fought on a day when the wind
carried the dust into the faces of the Turks; towards
the close of this fight I saw a couple of
battalions go right through and over all the
Turkish trenches within sight, and then get engulfed
in a great ravine on the very slope of
Achi Baba itself, where they were hidden from
view, and then I saw thousands of Turks stream
down through communication trenches on each
side of our men, filling the trenches in their rear,
as could be plainly seen by the bristling bayonets
which showed above the parapets.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
I felt that these two battalions were lost, as indeed
they were for two or three days, but somehow
or other, after some extraordinary hide-and-seek
experiences among the Turkish trenches,
they fought their way back again, clearing the
Turks out of their path, in hand-to-hand fighting,
as they hacked their way back to our own
lines.</p>

<p>A friend of mine, Captain Braham of the 6th
Manchesters, had a narrow escape on one occasion
when he made an attempt to lead his men in an
assault. Being short of ammunition for the
guns, the Turkish trenches had not been properly
bombarded; Turkish machine-guns and riflemen
were still in position, ready to mow our men down
the moment they leaped from their trenches.
This was the fate which overtook the 6th Manchesters;
they were practically cut to pieces before
they had advanced more than a dozen yards from
their lines, and the few survivors thought it
wiser to get back to cover as quickly as possible.
Captain Braham, however, tried to rally them out
of the trench again, and at that moment, while
standing on the parapet, a bullet struck his knapsack,
cut through the buckle, a box of chocolate
and a tin-opener. The tin-opener diverted the
bullet out through the bottom of the haversack by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
his heels, but the impact of it was so great that it
knocked him off the parapet into the trench, as if
he had been struck with a sledge hammer. He
told me afterwards that he did not know at the
time what had knocked him over, and it was not
until he had removed his haversack that the mystery
was explained.</p>

<p>During one of these dog days Rolo and I went
as far forward as it was possible to go, so that we
might get a close view of a battle which was to
begin at 11 <span class="smcap">A. M.</span> on the 12th of July.</p>

<p>Punctually to the minute our guns crashed out
along the line and pounded away steadily for an
hour. Then we watched the attack, and what impressed
me in this battle, as it did also in others,
was the inadequate force with which we attempted
to take the offensive. A line of our men would
dash forward, take two or three Turkish
trenches, losing perhaps half its effective
strength in so doing, and then find itself too weak
to do more than hold on, and very often they
could not even do that. There seemed to be no
regular system of sending line after line at intervals
into the fight. I know that this was arranged
for in orders, but it did not always come
off, and the men who had, with such gallantry and
at such a cost, taken the trenches, would be forced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
out of them in a counter-attack by overwhelming
numbers of Turks, and, in getting back to their
own lines, would again lose heavily.</p>

<p>To obtain a view of the battlefield from a different
point we made our way along a communication
trench, and here our interest in the fight in
the front was abruptly switched off and centred
on ourselves, for the Turks had spotted a Battalion
of Lancashire Fusiliers coming along to
reinforce the firing line, and they turned a most
deadly and accurate fire upon us from the Turkish
guns. Shells hopped from the parapets or
broke them in all round us, crashed over our
heads, and even plumped right into the trench
itself, sending men flying in all directions.</p>

<p>The Lancashire Fusiliers had, therefore, to
halt and take cover under the lee of the parapet,
and during this time one of the men asked Claude
Rolo what his job was in these parts, for, being
in our shirt-sleeves, and pretty grimy with dust
and with climbing about the trenches, he could
not make out who or what we were.</p>

<p>When Rolo replied: "Oh, I've only come to
see the show," "Oh, Hell," said the Lancashire
man, "you must be mad to come to a show like
this on your own."</p>

<p>I felt very sorry for the poor lads when they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
finally marched off. The day was hot enough to
make one feel that the only way to keep cool was
to sit in one's bones under the shade of a tree, and
yet here were these Lancashire men loaded down
with the whole weight of their packs&mdash;food, ammunition,
blanket, belts, bayonet and rifle&mdash;marching
on through this infernal heat to a
bloody combat, where they would have to put
forth all their efforts in getting rapidly across the
fire-swept ground, plunge into and out of deep
trenches, and, in addition, grapple hand to hand
with no mean foe.</p>

<p>Some things are more than human nature can
stand. You cannot overload the soldier, and
then expect him to pull his full weight in battle
with the broiling sun burning out his throat.</p>

<p>The Lancashire lads were soon in the thick of
the fight, and a great many never again needed
the shelter of a friendly trench.</p>

<p>We lost a few prisoners to the Turks in this
battle owing to exhaustion, and it is a comfort to
know that our gallant enemies treat such men of
ours as fall into their hands with kindness. I
never heard anything but praise for the Turk and
the way he played the game. I only knew of one
case of a prisoner being mutilated, and this may
have been the work of a German, for the victim<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
was a Sikh, and died before any evidence could
be taken. The Turk is a clean fighter, and more
than once they have pointed out to us that they
would be glad if we would move a hospital ship a
little further from the transports, for they feared
that in firing at the latter they might hit the hospital,
and, so far as the records go, this is more
than would have been done by the Germans.</p>

<p>Among the prisoners taken in one of these battles
were some German sailors from the <i>Goeben</i>,
who had been working the machine-guns. When
taken they had no more ammunition left, their
officer and many others had been killed, and their
position was quite hopeless, so they gladly surrendered.
They looked crestfallen and sullen
when I saw them as prisoners on their way to the
beach.</p>

<p>During these hot July days the Turkish shells
would often set fire to the dried-up gorse and
bracken near our lines, and, as the wind usually
came from the north, I have seen a raging line of
fire, hundreds of yards long, with flames forty
feet high, roaring and crackling down to our
trenches.</p>

<p>Our men, however, had taken the precaution of
cutting gorse down in front, so that the fire never
actually overwhelmed our lines.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
The Turks did not lack initiative; their snipers
gave us a considerable amount of trouble all
the time we were on the Peninsula. Two of
these men obtained some celebrity by their daring
and originality. They actually concealed themselves
between some of our guns, and before they
were hunted down and shot they had killed and
wounded several of our officers and men. They
were painted green all over, face, hands, clothes,
and even their rifles, while little green bushes,
similar to the gorse around, were tied to their
heads.</p>

<p>Their sense of humour showed itself in some
rather quaint ways. Once, when a bomb was
thrown over a barricade by a French soldier, hitting
a Turk on the head without exploding, the
latter shouted back "Assassin, Assassin!" On
another occasion, on the completion of one of the
heaviest bombardments to which we had subjected
their trenches&mdash;a perfect storm of shells
from field guns, siege guns, howitzers and battleships&mdash;as
soon as the firing ceased and the dust
cleared away, a huge placard was slowly raised
from the front trench, on which was printed in
large letters "No Casualties."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER XXI</h2>

<h3>WORK OF THE ZION MULE CORPS</h3>


<p>During all these battles in May, June and July,
the Zion men and mules were kept steadily at
work, and wherever they went it was gratifying
to know that they performed their duties satisfactorily.
Sometimes little parties of them would
be attached to different battalions, and when
their tour of a week or ten days' duty was over
they would invariably bring back a letter from
the Transport Officer to say how well the men
had worked, and how well they had behaved when
under fire. I have dozens of such letters, which
testify to their good work and how well they got
on with their British comrades, with whom they
were great favourites; the party commanded by
Corporal Nehemiah Yahuda was always in great
request, as this bright, cheery young N. C. O. had
a happy knack of inspiring his men with his own
zeal for work and devotion to duty, regardless of
all danger.</p>

<p>Sometimes while away from Headquarters on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
these detached duties a man would get killed.
His comrades always brought the body back to
camp, and then the whole Corps attended the
funeral, which was a very solemn ceremony.
Over the grave of each hero whom we buried in
Gallipoli was erected a little memorial, the Shield
of David, with his name and the date of his death
engraved underneath. Nothing brought the old
days of the Bible back more vividly to my mind
than to see, when one of my Zion men was
wounded, how his friends would literally fall on
his neck, weep, and embrace him most tenderly.
The outward expression of such emotion as I
have witnessed is of course impossible for us
Westerners, but I doubt if our feelings are not
harrowed all the more by the rigid restraint which
we perforce place on them.</p>

<p>The gallant Captain Trumpledor differed
from his compatriots in this respect, and I never
once saw him give way to any of these emotions.
On the contrary, he would remark to me over
the body of a badly wounded Zionist: "Ken,
ken! (Hebrew for "Yes, yes!") <i>A la guerre
comme à la guerre!</i>" And I must say that he
himself bore a bullet wound through his shoulder
with the greatest fortitude, carrying out his
duties as if nothing had happened and absolutely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
refusing to go into hospital. I am glad to say he
made a speedy and good recovery.</p>

<p>A couple of my Zionists were not quite so brave
as the Captain, for I observed them one day, when
we were being somewhat heavily shelled, making
tracks for the beach for all they were worth.</p>

<p>Their flight reminded me of a story which I had
heard, of an Irish soldier at the Battle of the
Boyne, who, relating to a friend how his Captain,
before leading them to the charge, said: "Now,
boys, strike for your King, your country, and
your home." "Some of the fools," said the Irishman,
"struck for their King and country, but I
struck for home!"</p>

<p>I am glad to say that the valour shown by some
of my men made up for the lack of it shown by
others. No one could be a braver or a better soldier
than Nissel Rosenberg, who, through shot
and shell, led his mules with their loads of ammunition
right into the firing line, when all others,
both Jewish and British&mdash;for both were there&mdash;made
a strategic and hurried movement to the
rear. I was watching this myself, and, as I considered
it very plucky of him to go forward with
his much-needed loads of ammunition, while men
were being killed all round him, I recommended
him for the D. C. M., a distinction he well deserves.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
He escaped all wounds that day, but a
fortnight later, when again on his way to the
trenches, he was severely wounded by a piece of
shell; I am glad to say he made a good recovery
and is still going strong. In appreciation of
his gallant services, I promoted him to the rank
of sergeant.</p>

<p>It must not be supposed that we only came
under fire on specific occasions. It broke upon
us at all times, night and day, without warning.
In these "strafes," as we used to call them, many
men and mules were killed and wounded.</p>

<p>During one such "strafe," I can even now see
Gye and myself running across a couple of hundred
yards of fire-swept ground to the rescue of
two stricken men, and I should not like to say the
number of times we both had to throw ourselves
down and grovel on the ground, while shells
plunged round us, making holes big enough for
our graves and covering us with dirt and gravel.
We luckily got through without a scratch and
helped to get the wounded men removed, as fast
as ever we could, out of danger.</p>

<p>Both were very badly injured, and I never
expected to see either of them alive again; one,
indeed, Corporal Frank Abraham, died soon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
after we got him to the hospital; the other, who
seemed even more severely wounded, with two
bullets through his back, and his thigh smashed to
pulp, I was surprised to find in a fair way to recovery,
when I visited my sick and wounded men
in hospital during a recruiting trip to Alexandria.
The poor fellow, when he saw me, seized my hand
and embarrassed me by covering it with kisses,
saying that but for my lifting him out of that dangerous
fire-zone he would certainly have been
killed. I was surprised to see that the man remembered
that I had been there to help him, as
he was in such agony at the time that I did not
think he would have remembered or known what
was going on around him. I reminded him that
he owed quite as much gratitude to Lieutenant
Gye as to me, for we had both helped to get him
away.</p>

<p>I must mention here, however, that, as a rule,
Gye would take on much greater risks to rescue
a mule than a man, for which on one occasion he
was highly commended by General Hunter-Weston.</p>

<p>Many of the Zionists whom I had thought
somewhat lacking in courage showed themselves
fearless to a degree when under heavy fire, while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
Captain Trumpledor actually revelled in it, and
the hotter it became the more he liked it, and
would remark: "Ah, it is now <i>plus gai</i>!"</p>

<p>It must not be supposed that all the Zionists
were saints, or that I did not have my times of
trouble and difficulty with them, because some
would occasionally murmur and hanker after the
"flesh-pots of Egypt." They were, indeed, true
descendants of those forefathers of theirs who
wandered in the wilderness, and whom Moses had
so often to chide severely for their stiff-neckedness.
Now Moses, in his dealings with his troublesome
children, had a tremendous pull over me,
because, when my men grumbled about lack of
water, I could strike no rock and make it gush
forth for them, neither when the meat and food
were scarce could I call down manna or quails
from Heaven, nor was there any black cloud to
interpose and hide us from the devastating fire
of our enemy. Although Moses had these Divine
aids, yet his task in shepherding over half a million
of people through a barren wilderness was
truly gigantic and could only be compared to
mine as the ocean to a bucket of water; with that
great example before me I felt it was up to me
not to fail in shepherding through our trials the
little host confided to my charge, so, like Father<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
O'Flynn with his flock, I kept my children in
order by:</p>

<p>
"Checkin' the crazy ones,<br />
Coaxin' unaisy ones,<br />
Liftin' the lazy ones on with the stick."<br />
</p>

<p>I found that the racial characteristic of the Israelite
made it necessary to hold him in with a
thread light as silk and yet strong as a steel cable,
and it required a tremendous amount of tact and
personal influence to weather the various little
storms which sometimes threatened to wreck our
family life.</p>

<p>There was great excitement amongst the Zionists
when I told them that the much coveted reward
for bravery, the Distinguished Conduct
Medal, had arrived from England for Corporal
Groushkousky, and had been forwarded to me by
the Commander-in-Chief. The Corps was paraded
in the afternoon and marched to the Headquarters
Camp, where General Stopford, the
General Officer in Temporary Command of the
8th Army Corps, inspected the men, shook hands
with all the officers and finally had Corporal
Groushkousky out to the front, and, after congratulating
him warmly on his gallant action,
pinned the medal on his breast.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXII</h2>

<h3>THE AUSTRALIANS AND NEW ZEALANDERS</h3>


<p>Towards the end of July, owing to the numbers
killed, wounded and in hospital, the Corps was
reduced to less than half its strength, and as, at
that time, we had no depot in Egypt to send us
recruits, it was obvious that, in the course of another
couple of months, this interesting and useful
unit would cease to exist, if the present rate of
casualties continued. The reduced strength of
the Corps having come to the knowledge of Sir
Ian Hamilton, I was ordered to proceed to Imbros
and report to General Headquarters there.
I had an interview with the Commander-in-Chief,
and the result was that I was commissioned to go
to Alexandria, and, if possible, recruit two fresh
troops of Israelites in Egypt, and there establish
a recruiting and base depot for the Corps.</p>

<p>A considerable stir had been created throughout
the Jewish world when it became known that
there was, for the first time in British history, a
Jewish unit fighting side by side with British soldiers;
and there is no doubt that the sympathy of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
Jews for the Allies was considerably fostered by
the presence of this unit fighting in their ranks.</p>

<p>In proof of this I received letters from Jews,
and, indeed, from Gentiles, too, from all parts of
the world, letters which showed a deep interest in,
and sympathy for, this Jewish fighting unit.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most prominent Gentile from
whom I heard was Colonel Roosevelt. I only
wish I could publish his heartening letter, but at
least I may mention that he was anxious to know
if my men made good soldiers, because a relative
of his was in command of a battery of artillery
in one of the Southern States, and he had reported
to the ex-President that, curiously enough, part of
it was entirely composed of Jews, who were
among the most efficient soldiers in the whole battery.</p>

<p>During my interview with Sir Ian Hamilton,
I brought these facts to his knowledge, but I
found that he was already well informed of the interest
and sympathy which the Zion Mule Corps
had aroused among the neutral Jews of the world,
as he himself had received letters from prominent
Israelites in America, and, among others, one
from the editor of the New York Jewish newspaper,
<i>The Day</i>, asking if such a unit really
existed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
Sir Ian Hamilton's reply, which appeared in
<i>The Day</i>, is as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<div class="right">
General Headquarters,<br />
Mediterranean Expeditionary Force.
</div>

<p>It may interest you to know that I have here, fighting
under my orders, a purely Jewish unit. As far as
I know, this is the first time in the Christian era that
such a thing has happened.</p>

<p>The men who compose it were cruelly driven out of
Jerusalem by the Turks, and arrived in Egypt, with
their families, absolutely destitute and starving.</p>

<p>A complete transport Corps was there raised from
them, for voluntary service with me against the Turks,
whom they naturally detest.</p>

<p>These troops were officially described as the "Zion
Mule Corps," and the officers and rank and file have
shown great courage in taking water, supplies and ammunition
up to the fighting line under heavy fire. One
of the private soldiers has been specially recommended
by me for gallantry and has duly received from the
King the Distinguished Conduct Medal.</p>
</div>

<p>It will therefore be seen that, in my endeavours
to keep the Corps alive, I had a powerful ally in
Sir Ian Hamilton.</p>

<p>I was the guest of the Headquarters Staff in
Imbros for a few days, so that I had an opportunity
of studying its ways at close quarters.
There was certainly no slacking here. Work
seemed to go on day and night, and the food and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
drink were almost spartan in their simplicity,
practically nothing but the rations which were
served out to the troops, officers and men alike.</p>

<p>I have heard some criticism levelled at the General
for being camped away from the Army, on a
secluded island, but, in my humble opinion, it was
by far the best position for the Headquarters
Staff and the Commander-in-Chief, because, owing
to the unfortunate division of the Mediterranean
Expeditionary Force into two parts, he
was more in touch, from Imbros, with Anzac and
Helles than he could have been in any other
place.</p>

<p>Of course, had the Army been all together, I
think to be with it would be the right place for
the Commander-in-Chief. It may suit the temperament
of the Japanese soldier to have his chief
hidden miles away from the battlefield, but I do
not think that this plan fits in with the temperament
of the British soldier. He likes to see his
General, and he likes to know that his General
sees him, and realises from personal contact the
nature of the task he is asking his men to perform.</p>

<p>While I was at Imbros, I made an expedition
across the island over hill and dale to the opposite
shore, and it was curious to see the old-world way<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
in which the Greeks, who inhabit the island, live
in these modern, hustling days. There I saw two
women grinding at the mill, and the oxen treading
out the corn, just as they did thousands of
years ago throughout all the lands of the East.
I found the people hospitable and kindly, ready
to offer the stranger a cool draught of water from
a gushing spring (and this was really delicious
after Gallipoli), or a platter of luscious mulberries,
which were then in season.</p>

<p>But what, perhaps, interested me beyond all
else was the view which, on my return journey, I
obtained from the summit of a hill, of the position
of the Turkish guns at the back of Achi Baba.
With my glasses I could see them perfectly
plainly, and could actually make out the gunners
as they served the guns. With a powerful telescope
this would have made a most excellent observation
station, as all the Turkish movements at
the back of Achi Baba could be plainly seen from
this Imbros hill.</p>

<p>When I left Headquarters at Imbros I took
passage on a trawler which called in at Anzac,
where the Australian-New Zealand Army Corps
were dug into the ridges.</p>

<p>I had, of course, a good view of the position
they held on the precipitous cliffs and hills which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
rose in successive sierra-like ridges from the very
seashore, and I could then adequately realise the
tremendous feat they had performed in gaining a
footing on these heights against such a brave and
well-armed foe as the Turks.</p>

<p>I had met the Australians before in March,
when I had paid them a visit in their romantic
camping-ground under the shadow of the Pyramids,
and it was in the same month that I met,
on the verandah of Shepheard's Hotel, in Cairo,
the chief medical officer to the Australian Army,
Surgeon-General Williams, whom I had met in
South Africa and London some fifteen years
previously.</p>

<p>Thinking that he would remember me, I sat
down beside him and opened the conversation by
saying: "Any chance of a billet with you, General?"</p>

<p>He looked rather blankly at me and said:
"Not a ghost of a chance unless you are an Australian.
Who are you anyhow?"</p>

<p>I then told him who I was, upon which his face
lit up with welcome, but he would not believe that
I could be the same man, and asked me to remove
my headgear so that he might have a good
look at me, as he said I had grown ten years
younger.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
"How do you manage to keep your youth?"
he demanded.</p>

<p>"Oh," I replied, "it is easily done. An uneventful
life and no worries," at which the General,
knowing something of my travels and adventures,
winked, ordered a couple of whiskies
and sodas, and over these we had a long talk about
things past, present and to come.</p>

<p>General Williams took me round the hospitals
and kitchens out at Mena Camp, where we inspected
the ambulances and other things under
his charge, and I was much impressed with the
completeness with which Australia had equipped
the magnificent fighting force which she had sent
to the aid of England.</p>

<p>It was a great pleasure to meet Colonel Ryan,
a senior member of the Australian Medical Staff,
who had served with the Turks as a surgeon in
their last war against Russia and was with them
all through the siege of Plevna. I had read his
most interesting book describing his experiences
in that war, and altogether I was delighted to
have had the pleasure of meeting this most genial
Irish Australian.</p>

<p>Camp life at Mena, for the thirty odd thousand
men in training there, was very dull indeed.
There was not much to relieve the monotony once<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
the Pyramids had been climbed and the Australian
colours had been planted on the summits, save
an extra dose of sandstorm. It was no wonder,
therefore, that every now and again the troops
would invade Cairo in force and paint the city
red; in fact, one night they painted it very red indeed,
when they held a corroboree round the blazing
ruins of a Cairene Courtesan's Temple, which
they had given to the flames, because the Priestess
had, in some way or other, maladministered the
rites!</p>

<p>The Staff of the Australian and New Zealand
Expeditionary Force, commanded by General
Birdwood, had their Headquarters at Shepheard's,
and there I met again young Onslow, of
the Indian Cavalry, the General's A. D. C., and
one of the nicest and handsomest boys that ever
buckled on a sabre. He was not only beloved
of men, but the gods loved him, too, and it was
a black day for me when I heard he was killed
at Anzac.</p>

<p>I thought of all these things as I approached
the little landing-stage on the Anzac shore, where,
as we dropped anchor close to the beach, we got
vigorously shelled by the Turks, whose guns,
most artfully concealed, dominated the landing.</p>

<p>In the course of the eight months' sojourn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
there, these guns were responsible for the deaths
of hundreds of the Australians and New Zealanders,
who were killed while they worked at loading
and unloading the stores and ammunition, which
were constantly poured into Anzac. In spite of
this shell-fire, all through the hot weather scores
of men might be seen swimming about and thoroughly
enjoying themselves in the water. A
look-out man was kept and when he reported a
shell coming all dived until the explosion was
over.</p>

<p>There are many good stories told of the Australians
and their want of reverence for the Staff
and their love for the General.</p>

<p>On one occasion, while a dignified and very
portly British Staff Officer, who had been having
a swim, was drying himself, an Australian
came by, and, giving him a hearty smack, said:
"Hallo, old sport, you look about ready for the
knife. Have you been getting into the biscuit-tin?"</p>

<p>Whatever the Australians may have lacked in
what soldiers know as discipline and etiquette
they more than made up for by their fearlessness
and utter contempt of death in the fight. The
very fact that they had gained a footing on these
precipitous crags in the face of a desperate resistance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
showed that they were a race of supermen.</p>

<p>In vain did the Turks, time after time, hurl
themselves at them in an attempt to drive them
into the sea. The Turks would charge, crying:
"Allah! Allah!" The Australians would respond
by leaping on the parapets of their trenches,
shouting: "Come on, you blighters, and bring
him with you." They fear nothing&mdash;God, Man,
Death, or Devil!</p>

<p>When we eventually plant our flag triumphantly
on Gallipoli, the flag of Australia and
New Zealand must float in the place of honour
upon the Anzac peaks, for here, in their shadows,
at peace forever, lie thousands of their bravest
sons.</p>

<p>After a few hours my trawler weighed anchor
and we steamed south for Helles, which we
reached in a couple of hours.</p>

<p>The skipper was a north of Ireland man, and
he told me much about the arduous life which the
men in the trawlers and mine-sweepers led. During
the first attack upon the Dardanelles some of
these went through a perfect hell of shell-fire, in
fact, right through the Narrows. For eight
months, scores of them were constantly on the
perilous work of mine-sweeping round Helles and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
the islands, or carrying troops to and fro; and all
this time they were daily under fire, or, during
the night, with all lights out, risking themselves
and their vessels. More than one sweeper, with
all its crew and living freight, came to a sad and
sudden end through collision in the dark.</p>

<p>As we neared the landing-stage I spied a new
kind of warship for the first time, and as we
passed close to her I saw her elevate the muzzles
of the two great guns with which she was armed
and let fly a brace of shells at the enemy's batteries
on Asia. This was the coming of the unsinkable
Monitor, armed with her terrible fourteen-inch
guns. I don't know how accurate her shots
were, but the Turkish gunner who replied was a
marvel, for, with his third shot, I saw him strike
the deck of the Monitor plump amidships. I
heard afterwards that this shell went through all
the decks and stuck in the keel plate. By a
great piece of good luck no damage was done,
as it did not explode.</p>

<p>When I reached the camp of my Zion men I
held a parade and told them how interested Sir
Ian Hamilton was in the Corps, and how he
wished it to be kept up, and with that view had
ordered me to proceed to Alexandria to recruit
two new troops of their co-religionists. I asked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
them all to be good boys while I was away, and
to work as well for Lieutenant Gye, who would
command them in my absence, as they had always
worked for me, and in this way keep up
the reputation of the Zion Corps.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIII</h2>

<h3>VOYAGE TO EGYPT</h3>


<p>To assist me in recruiting, I decided to take with
me Claude Rolo, Captain Trumpledor, and Corporal
Groushkousky, D. C. M. At 2 <span class="smcap">P. M.</span> on
the 25th July we steamed away from Cape
Helles in a little trawler and without adventure
arrived at Lemnos at about 7 <span class="smcap">P. M.</span> We immediately
went on board the Staff Ship the <i>Aragon</i>
in order to get a warrant for our passages to
Alexandria.</p>

<p>I must say that I was astonished to find such
a splendid Royal Mail Line Steamer as the
<i>Aragon</i> anchored idly in Mudros harbour,
merely to provide quarters for the Lines of Communication
Staff. She must have been costing
thousands of pounds per week and might have
been doing much more useful work on the high
seas, where there was a shortage of ships of all
kinds.</p>

<p>I have no doubt there were many good men
aboard who would prefer to have roughed it on
the island in tents, as did the members of Sir Ian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
Hamilton's Headquarters Staff at Imbros, and
there was no reason, so far as I know, why they
should not have camped on Lemnos.</p>

<p>It was twenty-four hours before we could take
ship for Alexandria, so, during the interval, I
went to call on a naval officer who held an important
Staff appointment, and who happened
to be at the moment in Mudros harbour.</p>

<p>I found the same old difficulty of getting about
in the harbour from one ship to another, and it
was only due to the courtesy of the Captain commanding
the <i>Aragon</i>, who kindly placed his
boat, cox, and crew at my disposal, that I was
enabled to visit my friend. It was a lovely moonlight
night as we skimmed across the shimmering
water and it was not long until I found myself
on the quarter deck of the "&mdash;&mdash;."</p>

<p>My naval friend had just finished dinner when
I got aboard, and was most sympathetic and
helpful when I told him some of the things which
were troubling my mind, and which I had specially
come to lay before him. I was anxious to
get him to use his influence to send more lighters
and more tugs to assist in the disembarkation of
stores at Helles. The landing officer there, just
before my departure, had begged of me to do
what I could in this respect with somebody in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
authority, as he said he had made repeated requisitions
for more tugs and lighters, but all in
vain. I was anxious, too, because the pier which
had been built by the sappers was of a very flimsy
nature, and I knew that the first storm that arose
would wash the whole thing away, and then, unless
there was a good store of provisions, ammunition,
forage, etc., on shore, it would be a
very bad look-out for those of us on the Peninsula.
As a matter of fact the pier was washed
away later on, and for some time the horses and
mules were on half rations, and we ourselves were
threatened with a shortage of food, but, mainly
owing to the excellent arrangements made by
Brigadier-General Coe, the head of the Supply
and Transport Department, Colonel Striedinger,
and other members of his efficient Staff, no
breakdown ever occurred.</p>

<p>My naval friend was not over pleased when I
told him about this shortage of boats and tugs,
and led me to understand that the Navy had
supplied everything which the Army had demanded.</p>

<p>It is of vital importance, when our Army and
Navy work together, as so often happens, that
the Staffs of both should pull together. I think
this could be ensured if a capable naval officer,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
having the entire confidence of the Admiral on
the spot, were attached to the General's Headquarters,
and a capable military officer, in whom
the General placed implicit reliance, were put on
the Admiral's Staff; these two officers working
together for the common good would obviate all
friction. Of course, I am aware that naval and
military officers are interchanged on the Staff,
but juniors are not good enough for this; they
should be senior men who could speak with
authority, and whose opinions would carry
weight.</p>

<p>The position of the island of Lemnos, some
forty miles southwest of the Dardanelles, makes
it an important strategic point, more especially
as it possesses a magnificent harbour which, with
very little trouble and expense, could be made
practically impregnable. I sincerely hope that
we will retain possession of this island for, with
it as a naval base, the Dardanelles can be bottled
up at any moment, and the whole of the adjacent
seas dominated.</p>

<p>Turkey at present still claims the island. It
should therefore be annexed by us as some small
compensation for the Gallipoli failure.</p>

<p>On the following day at 7 <span class="smcap">P. M.</span> we got on
board a transport bound for Australia, via Port<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
Said. I found myself the Senior Officer on
board, and therefore had to take command of the
troops, and among my other charges were some
fifty nursing sisters, who had been brought to
Lemnos direct from England, and were now
being transferred for duty to the military hospitals
in Egypt.</p>

<p>Soon after I got aboard we weighed anchor,
and I then put the ship's adjutant to the task of
detailing to their boats every individual on the
ship for whom I was responsible, as I knew there
were hostile submarines six or seven hours out
from Lemnos, and I wished to be as ready as
possible in case of an attack.</p>

<p>At nine o'clock I got the Captain to sound the
alarm, when everybody rushed and stood by their
own particular boat; I then made a minute inspection,
looked over the list of names boat by
boat, and by ten o'clock all knew their proper
places.</p>

<p>The night was hot, so laying a blanket on the
deck, I slept on it there. I was awakened out of
a deep sleep by a loud explosion. I leaped up
instantly, not yet quite wide awake, saying to
myself, what a funny time for an aeroplane to
drop a bomb. The next instant I realised that
I was at sea, and it flashed through my mind that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
we had been torpedoed. As I looked over the
side, I saw a shell explode a mile or so away,
over and beyond a submarine which, in the bright
moonshine, could just be made out. The report
which had roused me was a shot which had
been fired from our own 4.7-inch gun fixed on
the stern of the ship. The vessel was instantly
swung round so as to present as small a surface
as possible to the submarine, and we made off as
fast as the ship could steam. A British war-vessel
of some kind came up in a few minutes,
and we saw and heard nothing more of the submarine,
but during the few minutes while the
alarm lasted, things were pretty lively on board
our transport, and many of the nurses rushed to
the side to see what had happened, but there was
no sign of alarm or panic among them; they took
it all as a matter of course, and seemed quite disappointed
when we reached Port Said without
further adventure.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIV</h2>

<h3>RECRUITING IN EGYPT</h3>


<p>We were detained one night in Port Said, and
the following morning made our way by rail to
Alexandria. It was an interesting journey because
it took us along the Suez Canal as far as
Ismalia, where we saw all the defences and the
troops guarding it, and also the precautions
taken by the householders along the bank, who
had turned their homes into little sand-bagged
forts. It was on this journey that I saw, for the
first time, the celebrated battlefield of Tel-el-Kebir
where General Wolseley crushed Arabi
Pasha and his army, and there the graves of
British and Egyptian soldiers who fell in the
battle may be seen from the railway carriages.
This journey to Alexandria is rather a roundabout
one, for it is necessary to go almost to
Cairo before reaching the Cairo to Alexandria
line. However, we eventually reached Alexandria
in the afternoon, and Claude Rolo took me
to the house of his mother, Mrs. J. Rolo, one of
the kindest and best ladies it has ever been my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
good fortune to meet. Here, in this most comfortable
and luxurious house, I was made to feel
thoroughly at home. While there, I, unfortunately,
had a rather severe attack of fever, but
thanks to Mrs. Rolo and her nieces, especially
"the angel Gabrielle," I was soon restored to
health.</p>

<p>My first duty was to see General Sir John
Maxwell at Cairo and get his consent and help
in raising new recruits for the Zion Mule Corps.</p>

<p>When I arrived in Cairo, however, in the afternoon,
I found that I could not see the General
until the next morning, so I determined to go
and see a friend in hospital, but in which hospital?
That was my difficulty.</p>

<p>As I was standing in the verandah of Shepheard's
Hotel, wondering to whom I could apply
for information, up the steps from the street
tripped a charming young lady in nurse's costume.
"The very thing for me," I said to myself,
and without more ado I walked up to her
and explained my difficulty and asked her if she
could help. She was kindness itself, and took
a great deal of trouble to put me in touch with
my friend, and through taking her advice I succeeded
in my quest.</p>

<p>I saw Miss &mdash;&mdash; again on several occasions in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
the hotel, but not being of a forward nature, I
kept out of her way. General Williams told
me that she was an Australian lady devoting herself
to nursing the sick and wounded. I have
heard since that she has added beauty to the
British Peerage.</p>

<p>While I was in Cairo, I visited the Turkish
wounded in the Red Crescent Hospital there,
where they were well looked after and seemed
most comfortable. I met a very interesting
young Turkish officer, the son of Djemel Pasha,
with whom I had a long conversation. He had
been captured by the Indian Lancers when he
was reconnoitring for the attack on the Suez
Canal. He told me that he was the only survivor
of a party of twelve, and that he himself
had received fourteen lance wounds. He was
an extremely good type of Turkish officer, and
during the short time we were together we became
great friends, and on leaving him he took
my hand in both his and shook it warmly, saying
he hoped we would always be good friends no
matter what the politicians might do for our respective
countries.</p>

<p>When I saw General Maxwell he did everything
necessary to ensure my success in this new
endeavour to raise recruits; he summoned the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
leading Israelitish notables of Cairo to meet me
in his office, where he put my needs before them,
and requested them to do what was possible in
the way of getting suitable men from their community.
Two members of this committee took
an interest in raising recruits for the corps,
Moise Cattaui Pasha and Mr. Jack Mosseri, the
latter a well-known Zionist and a great Hebrew
scholar, thoroughly imbued with all the best
ideals of the Hebrew race. He was a tower of
strength to me, and organised meetings in various
synagogues throughout Cairo. One such
meeting which took place in the beautiful temple
in the Mousky I shall never forget. We walked
through this celebrated and picturesque part of
Cairo to the meeting&mdash;and what a walk! the
colours, the lights, the sights, and the sounds,
were all redolent of the very heart of the East;
even Rahab might be seen there looking out of a
window; but of all the charms of the Mousky, and
it has many, commend me to its smells! There
you will find the full fragrance of the East in all
its pristine power and glory! Threading our way
carefully through the narrow alley-ways, dexterously
avoiding babies, donkeys, mules and camels,
we at last reached the Temple. We found it
packed with people, and on the platform stood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
the Grand Rabbi of Cairo, a most imposing and
eastern-looking personage, and other notables of
the city.</p>

<p>Cattaui Pasha and others, whom Mr. Mosseri
had interested in the movement, made stirring addresses
to the Jewish youths among the congregation.
The result of Mr. Mosseri's efforts was
that, in the course of a few weeks, some one hundred
and fifty Jewish recruits had been obtained
from Cairo alone, and these I designated the
"Cairo Troop" of the Zion Mule Corps.</p>

<p>I am sure that Mr. Jack Mosseri will be glad
to know that the great majority of these men
whom he took so much trouble to imbue with the
old Hebrew fighting spirit of the heroes of the
past, proved courageous and useful soldiers,
when, after a brief training, they found themselves
before the enemy in Gallipoli.</p>

<p>While I was at Alexandria I was unlucky
enough to get my hand crushed under a motor,
and as it required a great deal of attention, I
used to go to the Greek Hospital every day because
it was close to the office where I worked.
This hospital was full of our sick and wounded,
where they were carefully attended and nursed
by an efficient staff of Greek doctors and Greek
nurses. I used to go round the wards talking to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
the men, and they were all perfectly happy and
contented, expressing gratitude for the care
lavished on them by the Greek ladies of Alexandria.
Dr. Petredes attended to my wounded
hand, and nobody could have been more kind.
One of the Greek sisters told me rather a pathetic
story about an Australian. He was a young fellow
badly wounded in the leg; the wound got
worse and worse, and it was seen that he must
die. He was told by the clergyman who came
to visit him that his case was hopeless, but he was
not in the least bit upset about himself, he only
grieved at the sorrow it would give his mother.
Knowing that a photograph would be a comfort
to her, he asked if a photographer could be
brought. When the latter had arrived, the brave
lad insisted on being propped up in bed, and then
requested the photographer not to snap him until
he could get a nice smile on his face, "For," he
said, "I would like my mother to know that I am
dying quite happy." In a few hours the boy had
passed away, but there remained a photograph
with a bright, cheery smile as some small consolation
for the bereaved mother.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXV</h2>

<h3>LIFE IN EGYPT</h3>


<p>While I was in Egypt a few things struck me
with particular force: one was the inefficiency of
the Police of Alexandria; another the appalling
callousness of the average Egyptian in his treatment
of animals.</p>

<p>It was an amusing sight in Alexandria to watch
the police trying to regulate the traffic. The
drivers would take absolutely no notice of the
policeman's raised hand, and would dash recklessly
over the crossing, quite regardless of what
might be coming down the cross street. After
being flouted in this way, the policeman would
leave his beat, run after the driver and, on catching
him up, engage in a wordy warfare for five
minutes. The same performance would be repeated
over and over again as each successive
Jehu came furiously along at his best pace.</p>

<p>I also had some experience of the lax methods
prevailing in the Passport Department&mdash;a most
important office in war-time, especially in a country<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
like Egypt, which was simply teeming with
spies.</p>

<p>A couple of my men who had been sent from
Gallipoli to the Base Hospital at Alexandria,
owing to wounds or illness, wished to resign from
the Corps and go to America, as they had no desire
to return to the Dardanelles. I, of course,
could not grant their request, so by some means
or other (bribery, no doubt) they obtained a false
passport, got on board ship and gave instructions
to some friends of theirs to inform me, three days
after they had left, that they were on their way
to America and hoped I did not mind! To make
sure that these rascals were not merely hiding in
Alexandria, I carefully investigated the matter
and found that one, at all events, had really
sailed.</p>

<p>I have referred to the cruelty which the average
Egyptian shows in his treatment of animals. To
give one glaring example: there is a steep incline
over the railway bridge near Gibbari, a suburb of
Alexandria. Over this bridge, the slopes of
which are paved with smooth stones, rolls a great
part of the immense traffic which goes to and
from the docks. Almost at any hour of the day
one may see half-a-dozen wretched horses hauling
overladen carts up this slippery slope, being unmercifully<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
beaten by their drivers, and falling
sometimes two or three times before they reach
the summit. I say, without hesitation, that such
a scandal is a blot on Alexandria, a blot on the
police officials, who wink at it, and a blot on the
British rulers in Egypt who tolerate such a state
of affairs. A couple of thousand pounds should
be set aside at once to remedy the grievous sufferings
which are daily and hourly inflicted there on
our unfortunate dumb friends.</p>

<p>I was told that a Society for the Prevention of
Cruelty to Animals flourishes in the country. If
a member of it ever goes up and down the Gibbari
Bridge, he must surely turn a blind eye on
the cruel sights which are to be seen there almost
at any time, otherwise he must be shamed forever.
This recalls to my mind a story which Gye
once told me about a leading light of this Society
who was on a visit to Egypt. He made a tour
of the Provinces, and at each place he visited he
was delighted to find that the officials were most
zealous supporters of the Society. As a proof
of their keenness for the League, they would conduct
him to the public pound and show him numbers
of maimed camels, horses and donkeys which
they assured him was the day's catch. Of course
it was all eyewash, as the wily officials had got<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
news of the coming of the great one, and told
the police to lock up the wretched animals for
just as long as he was in the place and no
longer.</p>

<p>While the Arabs show appalling callousness to
the sufferings of animals, they often exhibit intense
kindness and affection for each other; more
especially does the Arab mother show great love
for her child. A pretty story has come down to
us illustrating this maternal solicitude. An
Arab youth married a maiden whom he came to
love passionately, but he had great love for his
mother too, and of this the wife was intensely
jealous, so much so, that she told him one day that
she could never love him fully while his mother
lived, and that the only way for him to secure her
affections was to kill his mother and bring her
heart as a peace-offering. The wretched youth,
blinded by passion, committed this terrible crime,
and, concealing his mother's heart within his
gown, he ran swiftly to present it to his wife.
On the way he tripped and fell heavily, and, in
doing so, the heart fell to the ground. On picking
it up to replace it, the heart said to him, "My
poor boy, I hope you did not hurt yourself when
you fell."</p>

<p>I related this story to a friend in London, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
he said: "Now I will tell you a story of filial
piety on the part of an English boy. He possessed
a dog of which he was passionately fond,
named Paddy. One day a cart ran over Paddy
in the street, and he was picked up dead. The
boy's mother broke the dreadful news to her little
son while he was having dinner, saying how
sorry she was to have to tell him that poor Paddy
was killed. The boy was not very much concerned,
and went on eating his pudding. Later
on, however, in the nursery his Nana condoled
with him on the loss of his pet, whereupon he
raised a tremendous outcry, sobbing and weeping
bitterly. His mother rushed up to see what was
the matter, and on finding he was weeping for
the dog, said, 'But, darling, I told you at dinner-time
that Paddy was killed, and you didn't seem
to mind much.'</p>

<p>"'Oh, mammy,' he sobbed, 'I thought you said
Daddy&mdash;not Paddy.'"</p>

<p>Thinking this would be a good story to tell a
little boy that I know very well, I related it to
him, but as he took it very gravely, I asked him
whether he saw the joke, and he said, "No."
Now he possessed a black kitten, named "Mike,"
for which he had a great affection, so I thought
I could illustrate my story by saying: "Well,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
now tell me which would you rather see run over
and killed&mdash;Mike or Daddy?"</p>

<p>Having given long and serious consideration
to this problem, and with a troubled look on his
little face, he, after a great inward struggle, at
last said: "I <i>think</i> Mike."</p>

<p>During the time I was in Alexandria an attempt
was made there on the life of the Sultan of
Egypt, not the first attempt, by any means.
Now the Sultan is a kindly, good-natured ruler,
having the welfare of Egypt and the Egyptians
thoroughly at heart; there is nothing whatever of
the tyrant about him, and therefore there is no
excuse for attempting his life. I happen to know
that the Sultan was not at all anxious to accept
the dignity which was thrust upon him, but since
he has fallen in with the policy of England, it is
the duty of England to protect him and uphold
him by every means in her power. Let it be
known that in case of any further attempt stern
measures will be taken, not only on the perpetrator
of the crime, or the attempted crime, but on
the family and relatives of the criminal, and also
on the leading members of any political society
to which he belonged&mdash;because, of course, they
are all in league with each other and know perfectly
well what is going on&mdash;and if they knew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
that they would be punished as well as the criminal
they would take good care either to dissuade
him from the crime or give timely warning to the
authorities. If they fail to do this, their property
should be confiscated to the State, and if the crime
were perpetrated from a hired house, then the
owner of the house, who had let it, should be severely
punished, because in Egypt the only policy
that is understood by the criminal agitator is two
eyes for one eye, and a whole row of teeth for one
tooth; and the sooner our pusillanimous politicians
realise this the better it will be for Egypt,
the Egyptians, and the continuance of our rule
there. As ex-President Roosevelt said in his
vigorous and memorable speech at the Guildhall,
we should either "govern Egypt or get out." It
is impossible to govern such a country on the
milk-and-water policy so loved by invertebrate
politicians.</p>

<p>I was privileged, while at Alexandria, to meet
on many occasions Prince Fuad, the brother of
the Sultan, and it was at one of his many interesting
and hospitable receptions, for which he is
famous, that I had the opportunity of being presented
to His Highness the Sultan. When, however,
I looked through the windows of the room
where the Sultan was receiving, I saw that he did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
not appear to be very well (it was soon after the
attempt had been made on his life), and there
was such a throng waiting to be presented that I
determined that I, at least, would save him the
fatigue of a handshake. There were compensations
for my solicitude for the Sultan, because at
that very moment I was talking to a most charming
and interesting lady, whose people had hailed
from the famous city of the Caliphs, Baghdad,
and although her ancestors came from that dusky
neighbourhood, she herself was fair as a lily, had
gloriously red hair, and was withal as entertaining
as Scheherazade. At this same entertainment
I saw standing before my eyes and talking
to the Sultan a lady whom I took to be Cleopatra
herself returned to life. I was amazed to
see some one really alive so like the picture of
the famous Queen of Egypt, and yet there she
was within a few feet of me, carrying on an animated
conversation with the Sultan. I came to
know "Cleopatra" and her husband very well indeed
during my stay in Egypt, and I spent many
an enjoyable evening under their hospitable roof.
And what a delightful couple they were! I shall
never forget a little impromptu concert which
took place one night as we sat out under the
rustling palms in the soft moonlight. Cleopatra's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
husband melted all our hearts by singing,
in his low, sweet voice, "Un peu d'amour." It
prompted me to make the ungallant remark to
Cleopatra that I really did not know which of
them I liked the better, and ever afterwards she
whimsically pretended to be hurt at the lack of
discernment which I had shown.</p>

<p>Now, Cleopatra, before I bid you good-bye, I
will only say that I am glad you did not live in
the days of the Pharaohs, because if you had, I
am sure you would have been given to the crocodiles,
for you must know that once a year, in those
barbarous, far-off times, there was chosen for
that sacrifice the most lovely and the most perfect
maiden in all Egypt.</p>

<p>It was at some reception or other in Egypt
that I met, about this time, an officer who had
been on the Staff of the 29th Division in Gallipoli.
Riding about the Peninsula as we both
did, we met practically every day during two or
three months, and although we rode together and
were quite good friends, I never knew what his
name was, and I never tried to find out, as I am
not of an inquisitive nature. However, one day
he disappeared and his place in Gallipoli knew
him no more. I thought it was very likely he had
been killed, because his duties often took him into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
perilous places&mdash;indeed, any and every place in
Gallipoli was perilous in those days. At all
events, here I met him safe and sound, on which
I heartily congratulated him. A little later he
asked to be introduced to a friend of mine who
was also at the reception, so I was compelled to
confess that I had not the foggiest notion as to
his name. "My name is B&mdash;&mdash;," he replied; and
on asking him if he was any relation of &mdash;&mdash;,
mentioning a well-known public man in England,
with whom a few days before I left home
I had been walking up and down Rotten Row,
"Oh, yes," said he; "that's my father!"</p>

<p>My Gallipoli friend was, unfortunately, on the
Persia when she was sunk without warning in
the Mediterranean, and went down with the ship;
but his time was not yet, for he luckily came up
again, and was numbered with the saved, for
which Allah be praised.</p>

<p>I hope the reader will not run away with the
idea that I spent my time in Egypt in a round of
festivities and riotous living. It was, as a matter
of fact, very much the reverse, because even
when I went to these receptions I combined business
with pleasure by getting the people I met
there to help me to get recruits and to interest
themselves in the Zion Mule Corps.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVI</h2>

<h3>RETURN TO GALLIPOLI</h3>


<p>I was very impatient to get back to Gallipoli and
made several applications to the Staff both by
letter and by telegram to do so, but it takes a
long time for the machine to move! At last I
received the anxiously looked for orders for myself
and my new men to embark.</p>

<p>I had a little trouble with a member of the
Staff before I left, and, as it illustrates the pettiness
of some men even when great events are at
stake, I think it is worth recounting. I had sent
him my embarkation return, showing the number
of officers and other ranks bound for the Dardanelles.
In the meantime a telegram arrived from
Gallipoli asking for two of my officers to be sent
there immediately. I had them on board and
on their way to the front within four hours of the
time I read the message. Two days afterwards
when I came to embark, I had with me my men
and one other officer, but the red-tape, red-tabbed
acting Staff man objected to this officer going, as
he said my original application was for three officers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
only, and of these, he said, "Two have
already gone; you make the third, therefore the
other officer cannot go; he must be left behind to
look after the men at Wardian Camp." It was
in vain that I pointed out to him that this officer
would be of little use at Wardian, but that he
was invaluable to me, as he knew the various
languages of the men, which I did not, and that
I could not very well get on without him. He
was obdurate, so I said that, as I must have the
officer with me, I would, if necessary, go and see
the General and get his sanction. On hearing
this threat he took counsel with another red-tab
man, whose official designation entitled him to
write half the letters of the alphabet after his
name, and who, from the little I saw of him, was,
I consider, fully entitled to three or four more!
These two tin gods, having privily consulted together,
issued a <i>ukase</i> to the effect that it would
be impossible to allow the officer to accompany
me to Gallipoli. "All right, then," I said;
"there is nothing for it but to see the General,
as I must have this officer." This meant that I
had to motor some three miles and lose a lot of
precious time in order to outwit these ruddy obstructionists,
a thing I was determined to do at
all costs. When I got to the General's office, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
first interviewed his Staff Officer, Major Ainsworth,
one of the most sensible and helpful staff
officers it has been my luck to come across during
the whole campaign. On my proceeding to tell
him what I wanted, he said: "Oh, I know all
about it. Major &mdash;&mdash; has already telephoned to
me that you were on the way, and has said that, in
his opinion, you should not be allowed to embark
your extra officer." I remarked to Major Ainsworth
that it appeared to me that some of the
Staff were only there to obstruct, and I repeated
that this man was necessary to me for the efficiency
of my Corps, and that it was much more
to the point to have efficient officers in Gallipoli,
rather than to leave them behind kicking their
heels in idleness in Alexandria. This had the
desired effect on a sensible man like Major Ainsworth,
who tactfully told Major &mdash;&mdash; that I must
have the officer with me that I wanted; and so the
incident was closed.</p>

<p>On embarking for Gallipoli for the second
time I found that I had 1,100 men on board, made
up of 102 different units, many of them without
officers, and as I was again the senior on board,
I had to take command of the whole, and jolly
glad was I to know that I would only be responsible
for such a heterogeneous collection for two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
or three days. The first thing that I discovered
on going aboard was that for the 1,100 men we
had only boat accommodation for 700 in the event
of the ship being sunk. I asked the skipper if
he usually put to sea in war-time, when submarines
were about, with an inadequate supply
of boats, and I refused to sign the clearing papers
to say that I was satisfied with all the arrangements
on board ship. The captain fully agreed
with me; he anchored the vessel in the outer harbour,
and we went back together next morning
and interviewed the naval authorities, who were
furious at the delay in sailing and at my demand
for more boats, but at the same time promised to
send them out to us in the course of an hour or
two, and as soon as they arrived and were stowed
away on the deck, we sailed for Lemnos.</p>

<p>I am very thankful that we dodged the submarines
on the way, because with such an overcrowded
vessel, with so many different units, most
of them without officers, and hardly standing
room for everybody, and with very inadequate
means of getting boats out, I fear that there
would not have been many survivors had the vessel
been sunk. I issued orders to all on board
never to part with their life belts, as they would
have to depend on them principally, and not on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
the boats, for their lives. We were lucky to escape,
for just about this time the transport
<i>Ramadan</i> was sunk with heavy loss of life. It
passes my comprehension that ship-owners should
be allowed to continue the antiquated methods
of boat lowering which are still in existence.
How many hundreds of lives have been lost
owing to the stupid method in use! Ropes,
blocks and tackle are fixed to the bow and stern
of each boat, and to ensure that it should reach
the sea on an even keel the men using both sets of
tackle must lower away at exactly the same rate.
What actually happens in any time of excitement
is that one rope is lowered much more quickly
than the other, with the result that the unfortunate
occupants are tilted into the sea and
drowned. It would be a simple matter to lower
boats by means of one rope only, and this method
should be made compulsory on all ship-owners.</p>

<p>Captain Williams of the Munsters was my
ship's adjutant. I believe he was the only surviving
officer who had landed from the <i>River
Clyde</i> on that memorable morning of the 25th
of April; he had gone through that desperate
fight, and had been engaged in every battle on the
Peninsula since that date, and yet had come
through it all unscathed. He must have borne<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
a charmed life, and I sincerely hope his luck will
stick to him to the end. He practically did all
the work of the ship for me, and I never had a
more efficient adjutant.</p>

<p>We reached Lemnos in safety, and got into
the harbour at dusk, just before the entrance was
blocked up, because, of course, the harbour mouth
was sealed every night from dark to dawn, owing
to the fear of submarines. We lay at anchor all
night and most part of the next day, and, as nobody
seemed to take the slightest notice of our
arrival, the captain and I sailed across the harbour
in a tiny boat, although the sea was far from
calm, and, on reaching the <i>Aragon</i>, I reported
myself to a gentleman in an eye-glass, whom I
had never seen before and never want to see
again. He was very "haw haw," and said that
I had no business to leave my ship until the military
landing officer had been aboard. I remarked
that we had been waiting in the harbour
so long that I thought perhaps the military landing
officer was dead, and so I had come myself to
report our arrival. With that I left him and returned
to the ship, and soon afterwards we were
boarded by the landing officers, and the 1,100
men were drafted off to their different units, I
going with mine on a trawler to Cape Helles.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
We arrived at Lancashire Landing on a beautiful
calm moonlight night, and were received with
joyous shouts of "Shalom" (the Hebrew form
of salutation) from the veterans of the Corps.</p>

<p>I missed the face of Lieutenant Gorodisky
from among those who greeted me, for, alas, he
had died during my absence from an illness contracted
owing to the hardships of the campaign.
By his death the Corps suffered a severe loss.
He had resigned from an important and lucrative
post in Alexandria and enlisted as a private
soldier in the Zion Mule Corps. His ability and
soldierly qualities soon raised him to officer's
rank, and he was one of the best and most useful
in the Corps. Like all Israelites he was passionately
fond of music, and it was he who wrote
out for me the Hatikvoh, the music of which has
been arranged for me by Miss Eva Lonsdale
and will be found in the Appendix. He told
me once that, though the Germans claimed
that they were the most musical nation in the
world, yet all their best musicians were either
Jews or had Jewish blood in them. His death
was a sad blow to his widowed mother, as he was
her only child. Madame Gorodisky may, however,
be proud to have been the mother of such
a noble character, and it will, I trust, be some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
consolation to her to know that he was held in the
highest esteem by every officer and man, not only
in the Zion Mule Corps but also by those who
knew him in the French and British regiments
among whom we were camped.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVII</h2>

<h3>BEELZEBUB</h3>


<p>I found, on my return in September, that life
on the Peninsula was much less strenuous than
when I had left for Egypt at the end of July.
The Turks must have been very short of ammunition,
for few shells were fired for the first five or
six weeks after our arrival. I was able to have
drills and parades in the open, exposed to the
full view of Achi Baba and Krithia&mdash;a thing
which would have been out of the question in the
early days. It was quite a pleasure to be able
to ride about all over the Peninsula even to within
a few hundred yards of the Turkish trenches
without being shelled. Of course, in the days
when the Turks had plenty of ammunition, they
thought nothing of wasting half a dozen rounds
on a solitary horseman, and many a time have I
had to gallop at breakneck speed to avoid the
shrapnel which they peppered me with on many
occasions. I was very glad indeed that shells
were rather scarce, as it gave my recruits time to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
get into shape and get used to the conditions of
warfare.</p>

<p>The new Cairo men took to the life very
kindly, and soon burrowed themselves well into
the ground and adapted themselves to cave
dwelling as to the manner born.</p>

<p>In the evenings, when our day's toil was ended,
we had concerts round our camp fires and enjoyed
ourselves as much as it was possible to do
under the circumstances; in fact, at times we used
to forget that we were at war.</p>

<p>The camp-fire sing-songs were rather weird affairs&mdash;songs
in English (Tipperary, for choice),
French, Russian, Hebrew and Arabic&mdash;the two
latter made rather melancholy by the plaintive
wail of the East. Some of the men were first-rate
Russian dancers and expert wrestlers, so we
had many excellent little side-shows.</p>

<p>The concerts were always ended by singing
"God Save the King," the Marseillaise (for many
French soldiers would be present), the Russian
Anthem, and last of all the Maccabæan March.</p>

<p>We had many visitors to our quaint polyglot
lines; a strenuous lieutenant all the way from
Canada often called on us, and I was indebted to
him for an invitation to come and try my hand
at tent-pegging on a beautiful tan track which he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
had made and at which various officers used to
meet to run a course.</p>

<p>Now I used to be rather good at the game, and
I think I rather surprised my Canadian friend,
Maurice, when, in answer to his bantering challenge:
"Now, Colonel, show us how it's done!"
I took every peg for which I tried. It was good
to find that one could still ride straight and depend
on eye, hand and arm, and that the spear-point
could be made to strike the peg as squarely
and as surely as of old.</p>

<p>There was not a great deal of work to be done
in these days, as there was now any amount of
other Transport which took much of the weight
off our shoulders.</p>

<p>The lack of steady hard work made the mules
very frisky, and some of them were regular demons.
We had one which was rightly named
Beelzebub, for he was indeed a prince of devils,
and I veritably believe he made all the other
mules laugh when he kicked one or other of the
N. C. O.'s or men. He had an extraordinary
cat-like faculty of being able to plant fore and
hind feet into one's ribs practically simultaneously,
while at the same moment he would make
a grab at one's head, emitting all the while
strange noises and terrifying squeals! He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
pinned me in a corner one day, apparently to the
delight of the other mules, and I was glad to get
out of it alive! In order to make him pay a little
more respect to his commanding officer for the
future, I ordered him to be tied up to a tree and
kept for a day without food or water. This,
however, did not fall in with Beelzebub's theory
of things, so he gnawed through the rope in the
night and then made for the forage stack, where,
to make up for lost time, he ate about six mule
rations!&mdash;at which the other mules did not laugh!</p>

<p>No one was over-particular about Beelzebub's
safety, as he was not what might be called popular,
so instead of being put down with the others
in a dug-out, where indeed he would have kicked
them to bits, he was generally left by himself in
about the most exposed position that could be
found for him in the camp, and I am quite certain
that both Jewish and Gentile prayers went
up for his speedy annihilation by a Turkish shell;
but Beelzebub bore a charmed life. Shells
hopped all round him, cut in two great trees
which sheltered him, excavated enormous caverns
at his very heels, but the only effect they had on
Beelzebub was to rouse his ire and start him off
on a fresh kicking bout. At last a chunk of shell
hit the ground close to him, bounced up and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
"ricked" off his ribs, making a wound, not very
serious, it is true, but still not exactly calculated
to improve his diabolical temper.</p>

<p>I sent him off to the sick lines to have his
wound dressed. Now I never could find out
what he actually did to the veterinary surgeon
who tried to doctor him there, but this officer
wrote a polite little note requesting me to be so
very kind as to remember in future that his hospital
was for sick mules&mdash;not for Man-Eaters!</p>

<p>I have already mentioned that on the night of
my return to Gallipoli from Egypt a brilliant
moon was shining, and by the light of it I saw
great mounds of earthworks thrown up just to
one side of our lines. On looking closer, I found
that these were the emplacements for four heavy
French guns of 9.6-inch calibre.</p>

<p>I cannot say that I was over-pleased at the
sight, because I knew that the moment they
opened fire their position would be seen from
Achi Baba, and the shells which the Turks would
be bound to hurl at them would be more than
likely to miss the battery and hit my men and my
mules.</p>

<p>Two French officers were in charge of the
siege pieces, Captain Cujol and Lieutenant La<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
Rivière, both exceedingly nice men with whom
we made great friends. The gallant captain
was a great horseman, and I often delighted him
(for he had no horse with him) by mounting him
on one of mine, and together riding over the
Peninsula. Lieutenant La Rivière, who was a
much-travelled man, often entertained us with
stories of his wanderings and adventures in
Arabia, Abyssinia and the Soudan in the long
evenings after we had all dined together in our
cosy little dug-out.</p>

<p>While I was away recruiting in Egypt the
glamour of the Horse Artillery had fallen upon
Gye, and, furthermore, Davidson and other officers
of L Battery had beguiled him, so that soon
after my return he asked me if I would let him
go to the Gunners. I was glad to recommend
him for the transfer, for I felt that with his sound
common sense and good horsemastership he
would be of more use to the general cause as a
gunner than as a muleteer.</p>

<p>I had two British officers still left with me,
and here, too, was a case of good material being
wasted on work which could have been equally
well done by less brainy men.</p>

<p>Claude Rolo was an eminent civil engineer,
and had constructed some of the most important<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
public buildings in Egypt, and, of course, his
proper place would have been with the Sappers.
His brother, I. Rolo, with his vast business experience
in Egypt, should have been employed
as purchasing agent for the Army, where his
knowledge of local affairs would undoubtedly
have saved us tens of thousands of pounds. His
talents were wasted merely keeping the records
of the Zion Mule Corps Depot at Alexandria.
I recommended both for transfer, but I fear
their services are still being wasted.</p>

<p>I wonder when we will wake up to the fact that
we have plenty of talent if only those in authority
would avail themselves of it and use it in the
right way.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVIII</h2>

<h3>A FEAT IN GUNNERY</h3>


<p>By this time, after many weeks and months of
delving, the efforts of our Engineers and other
troops to alter the geographical features of the
Peninsula began to have effect. Long lines of
communication trenches were dug to and fro
everywhere. Indeed, the amount of earthwork
that was excavated in digging trenches and dug-outs,
both at Helles and Anzac, was simply
"colossal." If the same amount of digging,
trenching and dug-outing had been concentrated
into one effort, it would have been possible to
make a canal across the narrowest part of the
Peninsula, wide enough and deep enough for the
<i>Queen Elizabeth</i> and the rest of the British Fleet
to sail through, without let or hindrance, to Constantinople!</p>

<p>One good thing the diggers did was to make
the communication trenches wide and deep
enough to give ample cover to horses and mules.
In consequence of this, it was now possible to
take ammunition and supplies to the front during<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
daylight, and so most of our night work
ceased. Small detachments of men and mules
were attached to various battalions for transport
work, and all over the Peninsula Zion men could
be met cantering along on their mules&mdash;for they
were good horsemen&mdash;and they invariably rode
when they had a chance. They looked very
comical as they galloped along, uttering exulting
yells, their faces grimy, caps crammed home on
the back of their heads, jacketless and with torn
shirts, perched up on the pack saddles, the chains
of which clattered loudly at each stride of the
mule. Our soldiers, with their usual happy
knack for nicknames, christened them the "Allies
Cavalry," while a brilliant wit went even one better
and dubbed them "Ally Sloper's Cavalry!"</p>

<p>While the men were out on these detached
posts, I, of course, visited them at regular intervals
to see that they were keeping up the reputation
of the Corps and also to hear any reports or
complaints they might have to make. It was
rarely that a day went by without something
odd or amusing, or both, happening at one or
other of these detached posts. For example: I
had some men stationed up the Gully Ravine,
and just before I visited them the Turks had
given them a vigorous bombardment which had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
set fire to the forage which was stored close by
the mules. The last of it was being burned up
just as I arrived on the scene and, as my men
were still lying low in their dug-out, I shouted
for the corporal and angrily demanded why they
had not saved the forage. He replied: "Turk
he fire shells, plenty shells, hot, hot&mdash;too bloody
hot," which showed that their sojourn with the
British Army, if it was doing nothing else, was
at least improving their knowledge of classical
English!</p>

<p>Although Gye had by this time joined L Battery
for duty, he still lived with me in our little
dug-out under the great olive tree, which, by the
way, now supplied us with excellent olives. Being
with the gunners, he would occasionally get
early news of an artillery "strafe," which, as a
rule, we went together to watch from some commanding
position.</p>

<p>I was not surprised, therefore, when one afternoon
he came in from the battery and told me
there was to be a most interesting "shoot" on in
the afternoon, nothing less than the "strafing"
of a troublesome Turkish redoubt by the huge
guns of one of the Monitors. As this promised
to be a rare good show, we sallied forth on our
horses, taking the road by X Beach and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
Gully Ravine. On reaching our observation
post and seeing no sign of a Monitor in the vicinity,
I remarked to Gye: "It certainly is a very
fine afternoon for a ride, but I don't see much
appearance of that 'strafe' you promised to show
me."</p>

<p>"I think it will be all right," replied Gye,
"there is the Monitor away out at sea," pointing
to a speck close over to the Imbros shore, some
seven or eight miles away&mdash;a mere cockleshell in
the distance.</p>

<p>On looking from the speck to the redoubt I
said: "It is not a 'strafe' you have brought me
out to see but a miracle," because it looked to me
that it would be little short of a miracle to hit
that small redoubt which, of course, could only
be faintly seen from the tops of the Monitor by
telescope.</p>

<p>However, I hadn't to wait long for the wonderful
sight. Punctually to the moment when it
was expected, we saw the Monitor enveloped in
great billows of waving clouds of flame and
smoke&mdash;one of her great 14-inch guns had been
fired. Anxiously we watched the redoubt and,
incredible as it may seem, the shell only failed to
strike it by thirty yards, for at that distance from
it a great upheaval of earth could be seen.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
Again we watched, the Monitor. "Pouf!" went
her second gun, this time sending the shell plump
into the redoubt. The result was extraordinary.
Up went Turks, rocks, timbers, guns, all mixed
up in a cloud of smoke, flame and earth&mdash;a marvellous
shot! Three more followed in quick succession,
each one plumping right into the redoubt,
pulverising it absolutely out of existence.
It was as if a steam-roller had gone over the
earthworks. A few more shells were dropped
into the fort, just to make sure, and one of these,
having struck some hard substance, "ricked"
across the Peninsula, over the Dardanelles, and
exploded in Asia!</p>

<p>I took off my hat to the man behind the gun
on that Monitor. If he is a type of all other
gunners in the British Navy, the Germans may
as well scrap their fleet without further ado.</p>

<p>After watching this wonderful feat of gunnery,
we were riding back towards camp, when
we saw running towards us an old soldier of a
Scottish regiment in a state of great excitement,
apparently having something of importance to
impart. I pulled up my horse and asked him
what was the matter. He told me in the broadest
Scotch that there was a German spy a little
further down among the gorse taking notes and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
sketching the position of a heavy battery which
was in position close by the sea. I asked the
Scotty how he knew the man was a spy, and he
said: "He's goin' on verra suspeecious."</p>

<p>I got him to point out the exact position of the
supposed spy and then I arranged with Gye
that I would go up and open conversation casually
with him, and that if I made a certain signal,
he was to gallop off for an escort. I found the
"spy" dressed in khaki in the uniform of a Scottish
regiment. I opened the conversation by
asking if he had seen the magnificent shooting of
the Monitor, and carried it on until I found out
who he was and from whence he had come. I
knew that his regiment was forward in the
trenches, so I asked him why he was not at the
front, and he told me that he was going through
a course at the bombing school and so, for the
moment, was away from his battalion. He
seemed all right, but to make sure I sent Gye
over to see the Instructor at the bombing school,
which was close by, to find out if such an officer
was really there taking a course.</p>

<p>While Gye was away I strolled to the edge of
the cliff with the supposed spy who, I was now
pretty sure, was what he represented himself to
be&mdash;a British officer. Down below us on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
shore was the body of a dead horse, half in and
half out of the sea, and tearing at it was a good-sized
shark which we could see very plainly, for
the water was beautifully clear. My spy got
very keen on seeing this and, borrowing a rifle
from a soldier standing near, he made such good
shooting at the shark that it speedily gave up its
horse-feast and plunged off to the depths in
terrified haste. In the midst of the fusillade,
Gye came back to say all was well, so bidding
my "spy" good-afternoon, we rode off to our
camp.</p>

<p>There is no doubt, however, that the Peninsula
was alive with spies, and at night, on returning
from the trenches, when all the camps would be
in slumber, I have repeatedly seen flashes sent up
from the British lines towards Krithia, where
they would be answered, but although I tried on
several occasions to locate the signaller, I never
succeeded in doing so. Of course I reported the
matter to Headquarters, but whether they were
more successful than myself I never learned.</p>

<p>On one occasion, a night or two before we made
a big attack, I distinctly saw signals flashed from
the neighbourhood of the cliffs by the Gully
Ravine, where there was the Headquarters of a
Division, to the lines of the Royal Naval Division,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
from which a signaller answered back; both
then signalled to somebody on the hill where the
Headquarters Staff of our Army Corps were
established, and this signaller in his turn flashed
messages up to Krithia, where there was a steady
red light shown for a considerable time while
the signalling was in progress. I tried to locate
the signaller on the Headquarters hill, but failed.
I then reported the matter to the Chief Signalling
Officer, who told me that whatever lights I
had seen were not made by our people, as none
of the signallers were out on duty that night.
Gye and I found the spot from which the daring
spy on the Headquarters hill had been signalling.
It was most craftily selected, as it was completely
sheltered for three-quarters of the way round,
and his light could only be seen from the direction
of Krithia; I had not been able to observe
it until I came into a direct line between Krithia
and the hill.</p>

<p>The tricks and daring of the spy are wonderful!
It was common gossip in the Peninsula
that a Greek contractor who was allowed to sell
some tinned foods, etc., to the soldiers, had in
some of the larger tins, not eatables, but carrier
pigeons, which he would send off to the Turks
on suitable occasions, but whether this is true or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
not I cannot say for certain. It was rumoured
that he was found out and shot.</p>

<p>Some of our fellows used to do the most
extraordinary things. A sergeant, thoroughly
bored with life in the trenches, thought he would
like to break the monotony by having a look at the
Turks, so, shouldering his rifle, he sauntered over
to the enemy trenches and looked in, and there
saw five Turks, three sitting together smoking
and two others lying down having a rest. He
shot all five and then doubled back to his own
trench, escaping in some marvellous way the hail
of bullets that came after him.</p>

<p>Then there was Lieutenant O'Hara of the
Dublins, who was always doing some daring feat
and showing his contempt of death and the Turks
on every conceivable occasion. He won the
D. S. O. before going to Suvla, where, alas! his
luck deserted him, and he was mortally wounded.
O'Hara firmly believed that no Turk could ever
kill him, for he thought nothing of sitting up on
the parapet coolly smoking a cigarette, while
bullets rained all round him. When he had finished
his survey of the Turkish line he would
get down, but not before.</p>

<p>Another brave man of the Dublins was Sergeant
Cooke. If ever there was a dangerous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
job he always volunteered for it, and was constantly
out reconnoitring the enemy's position
and bringing in useful information to his officers.
He, too, was very lucky for a long time; he was
one of the few who escaped all hurt in the original
landing, but at Suvla, Sergeant Cooke, while doing
a brave deed, was mortally wounded, and,
although he must have been in great agony for
a couple of hours before he died, he never uttered
a groan. Just before the last, he said: "Am I
dying like a British soldier?" No soldier ever
died more gamely.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIX</h2>

<h3>THE FINDING OF THE SHIELD OF DAVID</h3>


<p>Soon after the Bulgarians had thrown in their
lot against us, the Turks, who up to this time had
been husbanding their ammunition, felt, I presume,
that there was now no need to be so sparing
in their use of shells, and they therefore took
on a much more aggressive attitude.</p>

<p>Turkish bombardments and trench "strafes"
once more became the order of the day. Not to
let the enemy have everything his own way, we
ourselves arranged, late in October, to make a
tremendous onslaught on the Turks. One of
their trenches, known as H. 12, occupied a somewhat
commanding position and had been giving
us a lot of trouble. It was decided, therefore,
to batter it out of existence.</p>

<p>Sharp to time, at three o'clock on a very
"nippy" afternoon, a most terrific cannonade was
opened on the doomed trench. Naval guns,
French guns, British howitzers and field-pieces
rained a devastating fire of high explosives and,
as if this were not enough, three huge volcanoes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
spurted out at three points of the trench, denoting
that some great mines had been exploded.
While the fire lasted, it was terrific, and the dust
and smoke speedily hid all the Turkish trenches,
as well as Krithia and Achi Baba, from our view.
The infantry were then launched and the trench
captured with very little loss.</p>

<p>Trench warfare, dull as it is, for those who
prefer a fight in the open, with a good horse
under them, is yet not without its moments of
fascination, and I often found myself in the thick
of a trench "strafe" when I really had no business
whatever to be in the neighbourhood.</p>

<p>Gye, Rolo and I were returning from one of
these trench fights in mid-October, when we ourselves
nearly got "strafed" at Clapham Junction,
a well-known spot behind the firing line on our
right centre. Our mortars, borrowed from the
French, had thoroughly annoyed the Turks and
they retaliated by bombarding our trenches with
shell-fire. We were pretty safe so long as we
remained under cover, but on the way back to
camp we caught it rather badly and only saved
ourselves by our speedy flight over an exposed
piece of ground which we had to cross, where the
shells were falling pretty thickly.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 700px;">
<img src="images/badge.png" width="382" height="362" alt="" />
<span class="caption"><br />BADGE OF THE ZION MULE CORPS (The Shield of David)</span>
</div>

<p>One<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
of the most annoying things the Turks
did was to mount a big naval gun "somewhere in
Asia" not far from Troy&mdash;as distances go in
Asia. This fiendish weapon had such a high
velocity that the shell arrived on us before the
report of the gun was heard. The sensation of
hearing the shell screaming a few feet over one's
head was most unpleasant, and we all looked for
the moment that the big French guns in our lines
would begin to shoot, as things were very disagreeable
for us while "Helen" was in action.
This gun was altogether so troublesome that we
had christened it "Helen of Troy."</p>

<p>Fortunately, only about one in four of its
shells burst, otherwise we should have suffered
very heavily, because many of them fell in and
around our lines. My men would calmly pick
up these unexploded shells and struggle off with
them on their shoulders to adorn the entrance of
their dug-outs! This used to horrify the French
gunners, who were close by and knew the danger
of touching such dangerous toys. I am afraid
my Zionists thought me somewhat of a tyrant for
abolishing these æsthetic aids to the beautification
of their subterranean homes!</p>

<p>Now and again, just as a reminder of the rigours
to come, we were deluged by a downpour
of rain, and then life in the trenches was almost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
unbearable, for, owing to the subsoil being clay,
all the water ran on the surface and speedily
filled up every trench, dug-out and hollow; and
this discomfort, coupled with mud, filth, too little
food and sleep, and too much shells and bombs,
made life in Gallipoli more fit for a dog than a
man.</p>

<p>As the cold weather was coming on, I determined
to build a good stone house for my men,
where there would always be a big fire going to
keep them warm and to dry their clothes when
they came back wet from the trenches. As it
was not in our zone, I had to get the permission
of the Chief Engineer of the French Army to
take some stones from Sedd-el-Bahr village, because
it was only there that building material
could be obtained. While we were pulling down
a house and excavating the foundation, we dug
up a slab of marble with a beautiful filigree design
carved round the outer edge of it, and in the
centre, strange to say, was the Shield of David!
The stone must have been very, very old, and
how it got there is a mystery. Perhaps it may
have been taken from Solomon's Temple in
Jerusalem.</p>

<p>My Zion men were delighted at the find and
brought the stone in triumph to our camp, and it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
was kept in the new house as a talisman to ward
off the shells. Strange to say, although they fell
all round, the building was never touched nor
was any one injured in its vicinity.</p>

<p>Our own dug-out was also greatly improved
when the weather became bitterly cold. We
made the fireplace and chimney-stack out of old
kerosene tins, which made a kind of brasier on
which we burned charcoal obtained from the refuse
heap at the Field Bakery. Altogether, our
dug-out was considered to be the cosiest one in
the whole Peninsula, as indeed it had every right
to be, for was not Claude Rolo, who was our
architect and engineer, one of the cleverest civil
engineers that ever passed through the Polytechnic
in Paris?</p>

<p>Our charcoal fire was very useful in many
ways; it made very good toast, for the bread,
which up to now had been excellent, began to
be sodden owing to the bakery being in the open
and, of course, getting the full benefit of all the
rain that often came down in torrents; and in
addition to the rain the unfortunate bakers were
at all times under shell-fire. Although the bread
was not up to the usual standard after the rains
set in, yet in the whole history of war I do not believe
that men and animals have ever been better<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
fed than were the troops, horses and mules during
the whole time we were on the Peninsula. The
variety of food might perhaps have been bettered,
but the quality and quantity on the whole
were excellent and reflected the greatest credit
on the organisation of the Army Service Corps;
in fact, it was the only department where
one could say all the time&mdash;it had done well.
The Ordnance failed at times&mdash;failed lamentably
in the supply of high explosives for the guns, but
this was through no fault of the ordnance officer
on the spot, who, I know, took every precaution
to ask for every conceivable article months before
it was required. Of course, he did sometimes
get the needed articles, and sometimes,
when it was on its way, submarines would sink
the ship, or the ordnance people said the ship
was sunk, which amounted to the same thing and
covered a multitude of sins. Those submarines
saved many reputations! All the sapper supplies,
however, might just as well have been sunk,
as it was impossible to get the smallest scrap of
material, no matter how urgently required, without
the most minute details as to what it was for
and all about it. There was any amount of stuff
one wanted in the Field Park, but when application<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
was made for it the invariable reply was,
"It is earmarked for other purposes."</p>

<p>This policy is all very well in normal times,
but does not do for war. Some men cannot
shake off the petty trammels by which they are
fettered in times of peace.</p>

<p>I have no doubt the Turks much enjoyed the
use of a considerable amount of this "earmarked"
material, which, if it had been issued
to us, would have greatly enhanced the comfort
of man and beast.</p>

<p>I remember on one occasion being in want of
a gallon of tar. Now there was any amount of
it in the stores, in fact, one could see it oozing
out of the barrels in all directions. I wanted
this tar to put on some ropes and sacks filled
with sand which I was burying in the ground to
make my horse lines and to waterproof some
canvas; so I sent a man to the R. E. Park, with
a requisition, hoping to get it back in the
course of half an hour or so; but no: all he
brought back was a letter to say: "Please explain
for what purpose you require this gallon of
tar." I was so annoyed that I replied: "To
make a bonfire when you get the order of the
boot." But I have some doubt as to whether<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
this message ever reached its destination, as I
had a very diplomatic adjutant.</p>

<p>The officers and men of the corps of Royal
Engineers who wore no red-tabs were simply
splendid, and it was with admiration that I often
watched them at all hours of the day and night,
digging trenches, making saps, or putting up
barbed wire, right in the very teeth of the enemy&mdash;"Second
to None."</p>

<p>It is sometimes of vital importance in war to
do the exact contrary to all peace tradition; but
men get into a groove, get narrow, and often fail
to rise to the occasion. I have a good instance
of this in mind. A certain officer refused to issue
sandbags from his store when they were urgently
needed. (This did not happen at Helles.)
"They cost sixpence each," he remarked, "and I
have got to be careful of them,"&mdash;a wise precaution
in peace-time, but utterly unsound in war,
because a few sandbags at sixpence each might
save the lives of several soldiers worth hundreds
of pounds, putting it on merely a cash basis.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXX</h2>

<h3>BACK TO ENGLAND</h3>


<p>Shortly before I left Gallipoli our Staff arranged
what the American soldier would call a
great "stunt." Materials for a huge bonfire
were secretly collected and placed in a commanding
position after dark on the heights near the
Ægean coast; near to it a mine was laid. At
about ten o'clock at night this was purposely exploded,
making a terrific report; next moment,
according to prearranged plan, the bonfire,
which had been liberally saturated with oil and
tar, burst into a great sheet of flame which lit
up half our end of the Peninsula. Our Staff
fully expected that the explosion followed by the
great fire would bring every Turk out of the
depths of his trench to the parapet in order to
see what had happened; so at this moment every
gun on the Peninsula, which of course had the
range of these Turkish trenches to a yard, loosed
off a mighty salvo. Next morning at daylight
the Staff eagerly scanned the enemy's parapets,
expecting to see them littered with dead&mdash;but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
instead they were somewhat chagrined to observe
our old friend the Turkish wag slowly raise a
great placard announcing: "No Casualties!"</p>

<p>The Turks were now much more lively in their
cannonading, and began once more their hateful
tactics of loosing off shells at mounted men.</p>

<p>About a fortnight before I left the Peninsula,
I was riding up from Gully Ravine, and, having
got to the top of what is called Artillery Road,
I met a gun team, and one of the drivers told me
to be careful going along the next couple of hundred
yards, as the Turks were shelling the short
strip of road just ahead. I was walking my
horse at the time, and continued to do so, as I
felt I was just as safe walking as galloping. In
a few moments I heard the report of a gun from
behind Krithia, then I heard the scream of a shell
coming nearer and nearer, and as I bent my head
down to the horse's mane I said to myself:
"This is going to be a near thing." The shell
whizzed close above my head and exploded a yard
or two beyond me, plastering some twenty or
thirty yards of ground with shrapnel. My
horse took no notice of the explosion, and continued
walking on as if nothing had happened.
Although I was anxiously on the look-out for
another salute from the enemy, I thought, if I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
just walked on, I would bluff the Turkish observing
officer into thinking that, as I took the
matter so unconcernedly, he must have the wrong
range and it would be useless to go on shooting.
It was either that or else he was a sportsman and
thought that, as I had taken my escape so calmly,
he would not shoot again, for at any rate not another
round was fired.</p>

<p>Although I did not know it at the time, Gye
had been watching the whole of this episode from
a little distance. He had seen the gun team being
shelled as it galloped for shelter down to the
Gully, and when he saw me emerge he felt pretty
sure that I would be fired on as soon as I was
spotted by the Turkish gunners. He told me
it was most exciting to watch me as I came to
the dangerous bit of road, hear the report of the
Turkish gun, hear the shriek of the shell as it
came along, and then see it go bang, apparently
on my head!</p>

<p>As was to be expected, where cannonading and
battles were the order of the day, there was little
to be seen on the Peninsula in the way of animal
or bird life. The cranes which Homer sings of
somewhere or other, flew in great flocks down to
Egypt, flying almost in the arrow formation of
geese when in flight, but with the arrow not quite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
so regular. I have put up some partridges out
of the gorse, between the Gully Ravine and the
Ægean, within a hundred yards of where the
guns were blazing away for all they were worth.
There were a few other small birds about, but
very few, if any, warblers. I came across one
dead hare, shot by a stray bullet, and I had a
glimpse of one live one as it scuttled away in
the gorse. The only other four-footed wild
thing that I saw in the Peninsula was what appeared
to be a cross between the merecat and
the mongoose, but slightly larger than the mongoose.
It was of a dark reddish-brown colour,
thickly dotted over with grey spots. I saw one
or two small snakes, but whether they were venomous
or not I cannot say, for they glided off
into their holes before I could secure a specimen.</p>

<p>A night or two before I left Gallipoli we had
a sudden downpour of rain which made the
trenches raging torrents, and turned the dug-outs
into diving baths; but still our men remained
cheery throughout it all; nothing can depress
them. The men of L Battery, R. H. A., like all
others, were flooded out in the twinkling of an
eye, and I watched them, standing in their shirts
on the edge of their dug-outs, endeavoring with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
a hooked stick to fish up their equipment and the
remainder of their attire from a murky flood of
water four feet deep&mdash;all the time singing gaily:
"It's a long way to Tipperary."</p>

<p>My escape on Artillery Road was the last
serious little bit of adventure I had on the Peninsula,
for towards the end of November I got ill,
and Captain Blandy, R. A. M. C., packed me off
to hospital. My faithful orderly, Corporal Yorish,
came with me to the hospital and saw that I
was comfortably fixed up for the night. I cannot
speak too highly of this man's behaviour during
the whole time he was with me in Egypt and
Gallipoli. In Palestine he was a dental student,
but he could turn his hand to anything, and was
never happy unless he was at work.</p>

<p>I spent that night in the clearing station close
to Lancashire Landing, on a bed having a big
side tilt, with a dozen other officers all round,
some sick, some wounded. We had a dim light
from a hurricane lamp suspended to a rope,
which was tied to the tent poles, and we got a
little warmth and a lot of smell from an oil stove,
for the weather was now very cold.</p>

<p>At about 4 A. M. I dozed off, and the next
thing I remember was a Turk leaning over me,
trying, as I thought, to prod me in the face with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
a bayonet. I made a vicious kick at him which
woke me up, and then I discovered that my Turk
was no Turk at all but merely the hospital orderly,
who was attempting to jab a thermometer
into my mouth in an effort to take my temperature.
It was 5 A. M. and the hospital machine
had begun to work, and whether you are well,
or whether you are ill, or whether you are asleep,
or whether you are awake, temperatures and
medicines must be taken according to rule and
regulation.</p>

<p>This same clearing station had seen some very
lively times, because it is close to the ordnance
stores, and in a line from Asia to W Beach,
so that shells used to fall into it both from Achi
Baba and from across the Dardanelles. Orderlies
and patients had been killed there, and many
others had had marvellous escapes. Scores and
scores of times have I witnessed the departure of
the sick and wounded, which generally took place
in the evening, and the clock-like precision with
which everything worked reflected the greatest
credit on Colonel Humphreys, R. A. M. C., who
was in charge of it from the beginning to the
end, and on the members of the R. A. M. C. Corps
who assisted him. From what I saw of the
R. A. M. C. men in Gallipoli, this Corps has every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
reason to be proud of itself. Of course, at the
first landing there was a lamentable medical
break-down, and there is no doubt that hundreds
of lives were lost because there were not enough
doctors, attendants, and stores to go round.
Hundreds and hundreds of badly wounded men
had to be stuffed anywhere on board transports
and sent down to the hospitals at Alexandria
with practically no one to look after them, excepting
their lesser wounded comrades; but this
was an administrative blunder, which does not
reflect on the pluck, energy and skill shown by
all those R. A. M. C. officers and men with whom
I came in contact in Gallipoli.</p>

<p>Colonel Humphreys saw me off on the morning
of the 29th of November, and I went down in
an ambulance full of officers and soldiers to the
French pier at V Beach, the same at which I
had landed in April, because our own pier at W
Beach had been washed away and could not
be used. While we were getting on board the
trawler which was to take us to the hospital ship,
the Turks put a few shells close round us in their
efforts to damage the French works on V Beach.
This was their last salute so far as I was concerned,
for I never heard another shot fired.
They were very good about our hospital ships,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
and never attempted to do any shooting which
would endanger them in any way.</p>

<p>As we rounded the stern of the hospital ship
in order to get to the lee-side, as the weather was
a bit boisterous, I was interested to see that the
ship was called the <i>Assaye</i>.</p>

<p>Now during the South African War, I had
gone out in this same ship in command of about
twelve hundred troops, and it was somewhat odd
that I should now see her as a hospital ship and
be going aboard her as a patient. I found
things very comfortable on board, and certainly
it was an immense change to us to find ourselves
once more between sheets on a spring bed
swung on pivots, so that the patients should not
feel the motion of the ship. We were very
democratic in the hospital, as generals, colonels,
majors, captains, lieutenants and senior N. C.
O.'s, some thirty or forty of us in all, were jumbled
up together in the ward.</p>

<p>There was only one nursing sister for our
ward, an Australian lady, Sister Dixon, who
certainly worked like a slave from somewhere
about seven in the morning until ten at night.
Her task was too severe, and enough to break
down any ordinary mortal. She was assisted in
the ward duties by Corporal O'Brien, who did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
what he could to make us comfortable. The
night orderly was a big kindly Scotch Highlander,
named Mackinnon, almost as tender and
sympathetic as a woman, who apologised profusely
when he had to wake us every morning at
8 A. M. to take our temperatures and count the
beats of our pulse.</p>

<p>The <i>Assaye</i> lay off Cape Helles in a blinding
blizzard of hail and snow, during which many
of the poor fellows in the trenches were, I am
told, frozen to death, or, as a lesser evil, got their
feet frozen during that very cold spell.</p>

<p>On the 27th we set sail for Mudros, which we
reached in about four hours, where we lay at
anchor for a day, and there was much speculation
as to whether we would be transhipped, or
go ashore and be put in hospital on this island,
each and all wondering what was going to happen.
One or two light cases were put ashore,
and then the ship weighed anchor bound for
Alexandria, which we reached without adventure
on the 1st of December. All of us who were
unable to walk were carried ashore by some stalwart
Australians, and then we were sandwiched
into a motor ambulance, still remaining on our
stretchers, and driven off to Ras-el-Tin Hospital,
which occupied an excellent position by the edge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
of the sea. Here I spent fifteen days getting
every care and attention from Miss Bond (the
matron), and nursing sisters Blythe and Jordon,
who looked after the patients in my ward. Ras-el-Tin
Hospital is used for officers only, but I
noticed that some of the medical officers were
somewhat young and inexperienced. This I
consider wrong, because in these days the lives
of officers are of great importance, and only
the best and most experienced medical officers
should be employed to look after them, and
get them fit for their duties as soon as possible.</p>

<p>My own little experience in this respect may
not be out of place here as an apt illustration of
what I have just written.</p>

<p>The senior medical officer in charge, a very
young temporary captain, without coming to
see me, decreed that I was fit and well enough to
leave the hospital for a convalescent home.
Now, I was just about able to crawl and no more,
and the matron and sister who knew the state I
was in, told him that I was utterly unfit to leave
the hospital. However, without coming to see
me, he still remained obstinate, and ordered my
kit away, but meanwhile, Colonel Beach, the
A. D. M. S. Alexandria, having come to see me,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
his experienced eye showed him that it would be
some months before I should be fit for military
duty again, and he told me I should have to go
before a medical board, who would dispose of
my case. The following day the medical board
decided to send me to England, and I was put
on board the hospital ship <i>Gurkha</i>, which I
found very comfortable, with excellent food and
a most excellent medical staff, a colonel, three
majors, and a captain, all of the Indian Medical
Service; and I thought what a pity it was that
some of these able and experienced officers could
not be utilised to take charge of such hospitals as
Ras-el-Tin, where they could guide the junior
staff into the way they should go. It is just another
example of not utilising in the right way
the wealth of talent which we possess in skilled
and able men. I do not for a moment mean to
suggest that the talents of these Indian Medical
Service officers were wasted on the <i>Gurkha</i>.
What I do mean is that one or two of the senior
men, would have been ample on the ship, with
a couple of younger men as assistants, and the
other senior men could then have been released
for similar work among some of the ill-staffed
hospitals in Egypt or Mesopotamia.</p>

<p>Colonel Haig, I. M. S., the senior medical officer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
on board, was untiring in his care of the sick
and wounded, and if a testimonial of his zeal
were wanted, it could be found in the difference
in the appearance which his three hundred patients
presented from the day when they came
on board the Gurkha at Alexandria to the day
when they left his hands at Southampton. I,
who saw it, can only say it was simply marvellous.</p>

<p>After eleven days' treatment in the capable
hands of Major Houston, I. M. S., I found myself
a different man when I walked off the ship
at Southampton, where we arrived on Boxing
Day, 1915, and reached London on a hospital
train the same evening. At Waterloo we were
met by a medical officer, who scattered us
throughout the hospitals in London. I was fortunate
in being sent to that organised by Lady
Violet Brassey at 40, Upper Grosvenor Street,
where I was never so comfortable, or so well
cared for in the whole course of my life, and for
which I tender her my very sincere thanks; and
I would also like to thank Doctor A. B. Howitt,
Miss Spencer (the matron), and the sisters and
nurses for the care and kindness which they
showed me during the three weeks I was in their
charge.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
It was delightful to have old friends crowding
in with gifts of flowers, and fruit, and books, and
all the latest London papers and gossip. Lady
Violet arranged some delightful concerts for us
at which such public favourites as Madame
Bertha Moore, Miss Evie Greene and others
charmed us with song, story, and recitation.
Among the "others" was Miss Marjorie Moore,
whose song, "Just a Little Bit of Heaven,"
reached all the Irish hearts there.</p>

<p>Harry Irving, too, came to see me one day,
and presented me with a box for the Savoy,
where half a dozen of us thoroughly enjoyed
<i>The Case of Lady Camber</i>.</p>

<p>Discussing the play at dinner in the hospital
afterwards, I remarked how well Holman Clarke
had acted in the Sherry scene, when the V. A. D.
nurse who was at that moment handing me some
soup remarked: "I am glad you liked him, because
he is my brother."</p>

<p>How wonderfully well the women of the Empire
have shown up during the war! They have
come forward in their thousands, not only for
V. A. D. work, where their help is invaluable,
but also for munition work and work of every
kind, which up to the outbreak of war it was
thought could only be done by men.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
Yes, the women have certainly come into their
own, and I for one am very glad of it, and proud
too of the fact that they have responded so nobly
to the call.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXI</h2>

<h3>THE EVACUATION</h3>


<p>When I learned in August of the Great Failure
at Suvla, and heard with astonishment and no
little anger that no further troops were to be
sent to Gallipoli, I knew then that the only thing
to do was to get out as quickly as possible before
the Turks could get a fresh stock of munitions
and reinforcements from Germany and
Bulgaria.</p>

<p>It must not be imagined that I was anxious
that we should leave Gallipoli after all our great
sacrifices there, but since the Government had
decided once more to fritter away our chances
by diverting troops to Salonika, when it was already
too late to accomplish any useful purpose
there, I knew that our position on the Peninsula
was hopeless.</p>

<p>Bad weather was coming on and it would have
been absolutely impossible to live in the trenches
and dug-outs. Even with the little amount of
rain that I had experienced, the communication
and other trenches were at times waist deep in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
raging torrents, carrying down empty cases, dead
Turks and other débris.</p>

<p>Had troops been left in Gallipoli for the winter,
the losses from sickness and exposure alone
would have been enormous; in fact, the Army
would have needed renewing every month.</p>

<p>It must be remembered that the conditions of
life in Gallipoli were entirely different to those
prevailing in France. There were no such
things as dry sleeping places, dry clothes, or
housing of any kind, and one was just as likely
to be killed in the so-called rest trenches as in
those on the front line.</p>

<p>One of the saddest things I know of was the
death of the Colonel commanding the King's
Own Scottish Borderers. He had escaped everything
right through the campaign, but in the end
met his death in one of the rest trenches about
the middle of November, by a shell fired from
"Helen of Troy" on the Asiatic coast.</p>

<p>When once it was definitely decided to send
no further reinforcements to Gallipoli, of course
the only thing left to do was to get out, and to
get out as speedily as possible.</p>

<p>But even after the obvious had become inevitable,
we still went on gaily, spending enormous
sums of money, laying down miles of tramways,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
making roads, bridges, erecting camp hospitals,
and doing a thousand other things&mdash;all very expensive
work.</p>

<p>When I saw this going on I began to think
that perhaps, after all, the Government were
really going to do the right thing, which would
have been to throw an overwhelming force of
Anglo-French troops on the Turks, catching
them, as they then were, with but little ammunition,
crumpling them up and thus accomplishing
our main object in the Near East. This would,
undoubtedly, have been the right line of policy to
have taken, and would have helped Serbia much
more than anything else, but some fatal demon
seems to dog the footsteps of our politico-strategists.</p>

<p>When our Foreign Minister declared that we
were going to uphold Serbia with all our might
he must have known that he was mouthing mere
empty phrases, but the unfortunate Serbians put
their trust in the pledged word of a British Minister,
with the result that thousands upon thousands
of them have been cruelly done to death.</p>

<p>The more honest and more noble plan would
have been to have admitted that, at the moment,
we could do nothing for Serbia or the Serbians,
and to have advised them to make what terms<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
they could with their powerful neighbour, assuring
them that, at the right time, when we were
ready, we would, without fail, not only deliver
them from the hands of their enemies, but amply
compensate them for the trials they would, for a
space, have to endure.</p>

<p>It is said that the gods strike with blindness
those whom they are about to destroy and it certainly
looks as if the gods had held the searing
iron rather close to our eyes; but, notwithstanding
all the mistakes and in spite of our politicians
and our blundering strategists, and in spite of
our neglect of science and scientists, I have still
absolute confidence, owing to what I have seen
of the splendid pluck and endurance of our men,
both in the Fleet and in the Army, that we will
come out of this great World War triumphant.</p>

<p>Let it not be supposed that our terrible losses
and disastrous failure in the Dardanelles have
been altogether fruitless. By our presence there,
we held up and almost destroyed a magnificent
Turkish Army and by doing this we gave invaluable
aid to our Russian ally.</p>

<p>Had it been possible for the Turkish Army,
which we held fast in Gallipoli, to have taken
part in Enver Pasha's great push in the Caucasus,
there is no doubt that the Turks would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
have crushed the Russians in those regions and
have made things look very black indeed for our
ally. As it is, I consider it is greatly due to the
Gallipoli campaign that Russia, during her time
of stress and shortage of munitions, was able to
hold her own in the Caucasus and, when she was
ready, assume the offensive, resulting in her recent
brilliant capture of that great Turkish
stronghold in Asia Minor, Erzeroum.</p>

<p>The knowledge that this effort of ours has,
after all, borne some fruit tends to assuage our
grief for the loss of those dear friends and good
comrades who now lie buried by those purple
Ægean shores.</p>

<p>We can well imagine that the spirits of those
heroes of France and Britain and Greater Britain
who have fallen in the fight are eagerly
watching and waiting for the hour of our victory;
and when our Fleet sails triumphantly through
the Dardanelles, as it surely must, and thunders
forth a salute over the mortal remains of our
mighty dead, their shades will be at peace, for
they will then know that, after all, they have not
died in vain.</p>

<h2>APPENDIX</h2>


<p>I had no idea when I was taken to hospital that
I should not see my Zion men again. I thought
I should be fit for duty in the course of a few
days, so I never even said good-bye to them before
I left. However, I am in touch with them
still through the post, and I am glad to say that
there were no deaths after I left and all got
safely back to Egypt when that brilliant piece
of work&mdash;the evacuation of Gallipoli&mdash;took
place. I promised to recommend those who did
well to the Russian Authorities, and I was glad
to forward the following letter and list of names
to the Imperial Russian Consul at Alexandria,
for transmission to the proper quarter:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<br />
<div class="right">
Headquarters, Zion Mule Corps,<br />
14 Rue Sesostris, Alexandria,<br />
December 14th, 1915.<br /></div>

<p>From the Officer Commanding<br />
Zion Mule Corps.<br /></p>

<p>To<br />
The Imperial Russian Consul,<br />
Alexandria.<br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,</p>

<p>I have the honour to state that with the approval of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>your Government a number of Jewish refugees from
Palestine, Russian subjects, were formed into a corps
for service with the British Army. I have already furnished
you with a nominal roll of all officers and men
of Russian nationality in the Corps. I now wish to
bring to your notice, for the favourable consideration
of your Government, the names of those soldiers who
did especially well while serving under my command in
Gallipoli, and I sincerely trust that you may find it
possible to have their names brought before the Imperial
Russian Minister for War for favourable consideration.</p>

<p>The following have distinguished themselves before
the enemy:</p>

<div class="center">
<span class="smcap">Officers:</span>
</div>

<p>1. Captain J. Trumpledor has proved himself a most
gallant soldier and has been already decorated by
H. I. M. the Tsar for gallantry at Port Arthur.</p>

<p>2. Second Lieutenant Alexander Gorodisky. This
was one of my best officers and he was a very brave
soldier. I was much grieved when he died as the result
of the hardships of the campaign. He leaves a widowed
mother who was dependent on him for her maintenance.</p>

<p>3. Second Lieutenant Zolman Zlotnic, a useful officer
and a gallant man.</p>

<div class="center">
<span class="smcap">Non-Commissioned Officers:</span>
</div>

<p>1. Sergeant-Major Joseph Yassinsky.</p>

<p>2. Sergeant Nissel Rosenberg.</p>

<p>3. Corporal M. Groushkousky. This Corporal has
been awarded the Distinguished Conduct Medal for gallantry
in the field.</p>

<p>4. Corporal Nehmia Yehoudis.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span></p>

<p>5. Corporal Isaac Yorish.</p>

<p>6. Corporal Frank Abram (killed in action, leaving
a widow and five little children).</p>

<p>I have only mentioned those who have specially distinguished
themselves, many others did very good service
also, and I am glad to be able to attach a copy of
an official letter, enclosed herewith, testifying to the
good work done by these Russian subjects while serving
under me in the British Army.</p>

<p>Trusting for the favour of your transmitting these
names to the proper quarter.</p>

<p>I have had a petition from forty-five N. C. O.'s and
men of this corps for permission to go to Alexandria
for a couple of weeks on leave. I would very strongly
recommend that this leave may be granted, as these
N. C. O.'s and men have been here (and have worked
well) ever since the original landing in April.</p>

<p>I consider that the men really need this change and
as their families are in Alexandria, I hope they will be
sent there in accordance with their request.</p>

<p>If,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
as I hope, my men are given leave to proceed to
Alexandria, I propose to give one half leave as soon as
granted, and the other half on the return of the first
party.</p>

<p>As these men have done particularly well, I trust
that their good service will be recognised.</p>
